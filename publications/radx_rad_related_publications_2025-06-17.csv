Tastes and smells can warn against danger and also contribute to the daily enjoyment of food, friends and family, and our surroundings. Over 12% of the US population is estimated to experience taste and smell (chemosensory) dysfunction. Yet, despite this high prevalence, long-term, effective treatments for these disorders have been largely elusive. Clinical successes in other sensory systems, including hearing and vision, have led to new hope for developments in the treatment of chemosensory disorders. To accelerate cures, we convened the ""Identifying Treatments for Taste and Smell Disorders"" conference, bringing together basic and translational sensory scientists, health care professionals, and patients to identify gaps in our current understanding of chemosensory dysfunction and next steps in a broad-based research strategy. Their suggestions for high-yield next steps were focused in 3 areas: increasing awareness and research capacity (e.g., patient advocacy), developing and enhancing clinical measures of taste and smell, and supporting new avenues of research into cellular and therapeutic approaches (e.g., developing human chemosensory cell lines, stem cells, and gene therapy approaches). These long-term strategies led to specific suggestions for immediate research priorities that focus on expanding our understanding of specific responses of chemosensory cells and developing valuable assays to identify and document cell development, regeneration, and function. Addressing these high-priority areas should accelerate the development of novel and effective treatments for taste and smell disorders.",Congresses as Topic|Genetic Therapy|Humans|Olfaction Disorders|Regenerative Medicine|Small Molecule Libraries|Stem Cell Transplantation|Stem Cells|Taste Disorders|cell culture|olfaction|sniff,"Mainland, Joel D|Barlow, Linda A|Munger, Steven D|Millar, Sarah E|Vergara, M Natalia|Jiang, Peihua|Schwob, James E|Goldstein, Bradley J|Boye, Shannon E|Martens, Jeffrey R|Leopold, Donald A|Bartoshuk, Linda M|Doty, Richard L|Hummel, Thomas|Pinto, Jayant M|Trimmer, Casey|Kelly, Christine|Pribitkin, Edmund A|Reed, Danielle R",Chemical senses,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2020,DC019578,1U01DC019578-01,phs002699.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,3.5,"The publication discusses the identification of treatments for taste and smell disorders, which is related to the broader mission of the funding opportunity and grant abstract.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation, and initial results of a multilingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in 3 distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste, and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± standard deviation), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and the lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Adult|Aged|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Olfaction Disorders|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Self Report|Smell|Somatosensory Disorders|Surveys and Questionnaires|Taste|Taste Disorders|Young Adult|head and neck surgery|olfaction|somatosensation","Parma, Valentina|Ohla, Kathrin|Veldhuizen, Maria G|Niv, Masha Y|Kelly, Christine E|Bakke, Alyssa J|Cooper, Keiland W|Bouysset, Cédric|Pirastu, Nicola|Dibattista, Michele|Kaur, Rishemjit|Liuzza, Marco Tullio|Pepino, Marta Y|Schöpf, Veronika|Pereda-Loth, Veronica|Olsson, Shannon B|Gerkin, Richard C|Rohlfs Domínguez, Paloma|Albayay, Javier|Farruggia, Michael C|Bhutani, Surabhi|Fjaeldstad, Alexander W|Kumar, Ritesh|Menini, Anna|Bensafi, Moustafa|Sandell, Mari|Konstantinidis, Iordanis|Di Pizio, Antonella|Genovese, Federica|Öztürk, Lina|Thomas-Danguin, Thierry|Frasnelli, Johannes|Boesveldt, Sanne|Saatci, Özlem|Saraiva, Luis R|Lin, Cailu|Golebiowski, Jérôme|Hwang, Liang-Dar|Ozdener, Mehmet Hakan|Guàrdia, Maria Dolors|Laudamiel, Christophe|Ritchie, Marina|Havlícek, Jan|Pierron, Denis|Roura, Eugeni|Navarro, Marta|Nolden, Alissa A|Lim, Juyun|Whitcroft, Katherine L|Colquitt, Lauren R|Ferdenzi, Camille|Brindha, Evelyn V|Altundag, Aytug|Macchi, Alberto|Nunez-Parra, Alexia|Patel, Zara M|Fiorucci, Sébastien|Philpott, Carl M|Smith, Barry C|Lundström, Johan N|Mucignat, Carla|Parker, Jane K|van den Brink, Mirjam|Schmuker, Michael|Fischmeister, Florian Ph S|Heinbockel, Thomas|Shields, Vonnie D C|Faraji, Farhoud|Santamaría, Enrique|Fredborg, William E A|Morini, Gabriella|Olofsson, Jonas K|Jalessi, Maryam|Karni, Noam|D'Errico, Anna|Alizadeh, Rafieh|Pellegrino, Robert|Meyer, Pablo|Huart, Caroline|Chen, Ben|Soler, Graciela M|Alwashahi, Mohammed K|Welge-Lüssen, Antje|Freiherr, Jessica|de Groot, Jasper H B|Klein, Hadar|Okamoto, Masako|Singh, Preet Bano|Hsieh, Julien W||Reed, Danielle R|Hummel, Thomas|Munger, Steven D|Hayes, John E",Chemical senses,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2020,DC019578,1U01DC019578-01,phs002699.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses the impact of COVID-19 on multiple chemosensory modalities, including smell, taste, and chemesthesis, which aligns with the funding opportunity's focus on chemosensory testing as a COVID-19 screening tool.

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""smell,"" and/or ""olfaction."" We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss-subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli-to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020.

We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19. This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean±SD, C19+: -82.5±27.2 points; C19-: -59.8±37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing no significant model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset. As smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss.

Although the majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multiorgan involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials.

This is a retrospective single-center study of patients younger than 21 years presenting between March 1 and May 15, 2020. Included patients met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C (inflammation, fever, involvement of 2 organ systems, lack of alternative diagnoses). We defined 3 subgroups by clinical outcomes: (1) critical illness requiring intensive care interventions; (2) patients meeting Kawasaki disease (KD) criteria but not requiring critical care; and (3) mild illness not meeting either criteria. A comparator cohort included patients with KD at our institution during the same time frame in 2019. Thirty-three patients were included (5, critical; 8, 2020 KD; 20, mild). The median age for the critical group was 10.9 years (2.7 for 2020 KD; 6.0 for mild, P = 0.033). The critical group had lower median absolute lymphocyte count (850 vs 3005 vs 2940/uL, P = 0.005), platelets (150 vs 361 vs 252 k/uL, P = 0.005), and sodium (129 vs 136 vs 136 mmol/L, P = 0.002), and higher creatinine (0.7 vs 0.2 vs 0.3 mg/dL, P = 0.002). In the critical group, 60% required vasoactive medications, and 40% required mechanical ventilation. Clinical and laboratories features were similar between the 2020 and 2019 KD groups. We describe 3 groups with inflammatory syndromes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The initial profile of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and abnormal creatinine may help distinguish critically ill MIS-C patients from classic/atypical KD or more benign acute inflammation.","Adolescent|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Child|Coronavirus Infections|Critical Care|Diagnosis, Differential|Disease Management|Female|Humans|Male|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2","Corwin, Daniel J|Sartori, Laura F|Chiotos, Kathleen|Odom John, Audrey R|Cohn, Keri|Bassiri, Hamid|Behrens, Edward M|Teachey, David T|Henrickson, Sarah E|Diorio, Caroline J|Zorc, Joseph J|Balamuth, Fran",Pediatric emergency care,Journal Article,2020,HD105594,1R61HD105594-01,phs002603.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses a study comparing clinical and laboratory features among children with MIS-C, Kawasaki Disease (KD), and other inflammatory illnesses during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.","Biological Assay|COVID-19|Humans|Hydrodynamics|Influenza, Human|Magnetic Phenomena|Magnetite Nanoparticles|Particle Size|Smartphone|Streptavidin|Surface Properties|bioassay|magnetic particle spectrometer|point-of-care|portable|wash-free","Wu, Kai|Chugh, Vinit Kumar|di Girolamo, Arturo|Liu, Jinming|Saha, Renata|Su, Diqing|Krishna, Venkatramana D|Nair, Abilash|Davies, Will|Wang, Yongqiang Andrew|Cheeran, Maxim C-J|Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article,2021,DE030832,1R42DE030832-01,phs002572.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,4.5,"The publication abstract describes a portable magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) device designed for rapid, wash-free bioassays.

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","Adolescent|Adult|Aging|COVID-19|Child|Child, Preschool|Female|Flow Cytometry|Humans|Leukopenia|Lymphocyte Activation|Male|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|T-Lymphocytes|Young Adult","Vella, Laura A|Giles, Josephine R|Baxter, Amy E|Oldridge, Derek A|Diorio, Caroline|Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia|Alanio, Cécile|Pampena, M Betina|Wu, Jennifer E|Chen, Zeyu|Huang, Yinghui Jane|Anderson, Elizabeth M|Gouma, Sigrid|McNerney, Kevin O|Chase, Julie|Burudpakdee, Chakkapong|Lee, Jessica H|Apostolidis, Sokratis A|Huang, Alexander C|Mathew, Divij|Kuthuru, Oliva|Goodwin, Eileen C|Weirick, Madison E|Bolton, Marcus J|Arevalo, Claudia P|Ramos, Andre|Jasen, C J|Conrey, Peyton E|Sayed, Samir|Giannini, Heather M|D'Andrea, Kurt||Meyer, Nuala J|Behrens, Edward M|Bassiri, Hamid|Hensley, Scott E|Henrickson, Sarah E|Teachey, David T|Betts, Michael R|Wherry, E John",Science immunology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2021,HD105594,1R61HD105594-01,phs002603.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses deep immune profiling of MIS-C, highlighting immune activation patterns and their temporal differences compared to other COVID-19 cases.

To address this need, we developed the SCENTinel 1.0 test, which rapidly evaluates 3 olfactory functions: detection, intensity, and identification. We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N = 111, 47 ± 13 years old, F = 71%) and normosmic individuals (N = 154, 47 ± 14 years old, F = 74%) as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N = 42, 55 ± 10 years old, F = 67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria compared with only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders.

Diagnosing viral infections often requires invasive sampling, and interpretation often requires specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we test the hypothesis that a breath test could diagnose influenza and rhinovirus infections using an in vitro model of the human airway. Cultured primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were infected with either influenza A H1N1 or rhinovirus 1B and compared with healthy control cells. Headspace volatile metabolite measurements of cell cultures were made at 12-hour time points postinfection using a thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Based on 54 compounds, statistical models distinguished volatile organic compound profiles of influenza- and rhinovirus-infected cells from healthy counterparts. Area under the curve values were 0.94 for influenza, 0.90 for rhinovirus, and 0.75 for controls. Regression analysis predicted how many hours prior cells became infected with a root mean square error of 6.35 hours for influenza- and 3.32 hours for rhinovirus-infected cells. Volatile biomarkers released by bronchial epithelial cells could not only be used to diagnose whether cells were infected, but also the timing of infection.

Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained <i>n</i> dyes (<i>n</i> = 2, 3, or 4) with <i>n</i> - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe.

We ascertained the time course of intradialytic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) in MHD patients between 4 weeks pre-diagnosis and the week post-diagnosis of COVID-19. We conducted a quality improvement project in confirmed COVID-19 in-center MHD patients from 11 dialysis facilities. In patients with an arterio-venous access, SaO<sub>2</sub> was measured 1×/min during dialysis using the Crit-Line monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, USA). We extracted demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data, and COVID-19-related symptoms from the patients' electronic health records. Intradialytic SaO<sub>2</sub> was available in 52 patients (29 males; mean ± standard deviation age 66.5 ± 15.7 years) contributing 338 HD treatments. Mean time between onset of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 1.1 days (median 0; range 0-9). Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis the rate of HD treatments with hypoxemia, defined as treatment-level average SaO<sub>2</sub> <90%, increased from 2.8% (2-4 weeks pre-diagnosis) to 12.2% (1 week) and 20.7% (3 days pre-diagnosis). Intradialytic O<sub>2</sub> supplementation increased sharply post-diagnosis. Eleven patients died from COVID-19 within 5 weeks. Compared with patients who recovered from COVID-19, demised patients showed a more pronounced decline in SaO<sub>2</sub> prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In HD patients, hypoxemia may precede the onset of clinical symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19. A steep decline of SaO<sub>2</sub> is associated with poor patient outcomes.

While many groups have studied face coverings as personal protective equipment, these respiratory droplets can also serve as a diagnostic fluid to report on health state; surprisingly, studies of face coverings from this perspective are quite limited. Here, we determined the concentration and distribution of aerosolized saliva (<i>via</i> α-amylase levels) captured on various face coverings. Our results showed that α-amylase accumulated on face coverings in a time-dependent way albeit at different levels, <i>e.g</i>., neck gaiters and surgical masks captured about 3-fold more α-amylase than cloth masks and N95 respirators. In addition, the saliva aerosols were primarily detected on the inner layer of multilayered face coverings.

To describe the short-term evolution of cardiac complications and associated risk factors in patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. Retrospective single-centre study of confirmed multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children treated from 29 March, 2020 to 1 September, 2020. Cardiac complications during the acute phase were defined as decreased systolic function, coronary artery abnormalities, pericardial effusion, or mitral and/or tricuspid valve regurgitation. Patients with or without cardiac complications were compared with chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum. Thirty-nine children with median (interquartile range) age 7.8 (3.6-12.7) years were included. Nineteen (49%) patients developed cardiac complications including systolic dysfunction (33%), valvular regurgitation (31%), coronary artery abnormalities (18%), and pericardial effusion (5%).

We determined whether dysfunction is global or regional, and whether it is associated with the cytokine milieu, microangiopathy, or severity of shock. Methods and Results We analyzed echocardiographic parameters of myocardial deformation and compared global and segmental left ventricular strain between 43 cases with MIS-C ≤18 years old and 40 controls. Primary outcomes included left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain), and left atrial strain. We evaluated relationships between strain and profiles of 10 proinflammatory cytokines, microangiopathic features (soluble C5b9), and vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Compared with controls, cases with MIS-C had significant impairments in all parameters of systolic and diastolic function. 65% of cases with MIS-C had abnormal left ventricular function (<b>|</b>global longitudinal strain<b>|</b><17%), although elevations of cytokines were modest. All left ventricular segments were involved, without apical or basal dominance to suggest acute stress cardiomyopathy. Worse global longitudinal strain correlated with higher ratios of interleukin-6 (ρ -0.43) and interleukin-8 (ρ -0.43) to total hypercytokinemia, but not absolute levels of interleukin-6 or interleukin-8, or total hypercytokinemia. Similarly, worse right ventricular free wall strain correlated with higher relative interleukin-8 expression (ρ -0.59). There were no significant associations between function and microangiopathy or vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Conclusions Myocardial function is globally decreased in MIS-C and not explained by acute stress cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction may be driven by the relative skew of the immune response toward interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 pathways, more so than degree of hyperinflammation, refining the current paradigm of myocardial involvement in MIS-C.","Adolescent|Age Factors|Atrial Function, Left|Biomarkers|COVID-19|COVID‐19|Child|Cross-Sectional Studies|Cytokine Release Syndrome|Cytokines|Echocardiography|Female|Heart Diseases|Humans|Inflammation Mediators|Male|Prognosis|Retrospective Studies|Risk Assessment|Risk Factors|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|Ventricular Function, Left|Ventricular Function, Right|cytokine storm|echocardiography|multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children|myocardial deformation","Chang, Joyce C|Matsubara, Daisuke|Morgan, Ryan W|Diorio, Caroline|Nadaraj, Sumekala|Teachey, David T|Bassiri, Hamid|Behrens, Edward M|Banerjee, Anirban",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2021,HD105594,1R61HD105594-01,phs002603.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses the cytokine responses and their association with cardiac dysfunction in MIS-C, which aligns with the research objectives of the funding opportunity and grant abstract.

We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide (β ~ 8.99 ∗ ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample collection frequency from weekly to daily. Coupling simpler and faster detection technology with more frequent sampling has the potential to improve the predictive potential of using WBS of SARS-CoV-2 for early detection of the onset of COVID-19.","COVID-19|Concentration|Detection|Humans|Pandemics|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Sampling|Wastewater|Wastewater based surveillance","Sharkey, Mark E|Kumar, Naresh|Mantero, Alejandro M A|Babler, Kristina M|Boone, Melinda M|Cardentey, Yoslayma|Cortizas, Elena M|Grills, George S|Herrin, James|Kemper, Jenny M|Kenney, Richard|Kobetz, Erin|Laine, Jennifer|Lamar, Walter E|Mader, Christopher C|Mason, Christopher E|Quintero, Anda Z|Reding, Brian D|Roca, Matthew A|Ryon, Krista|Solle, Natasha Schaefer|Schürer, Stephan C|Shukla, Bhavarth|Stevenson, Mario|Stone, Thomas|Tallon, John J|Venkatapuram, Sreeharsha S|Vidovic, Dusica|Williams, Sion L|Young, Benjamin|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M",The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,2021,DA053941,1U01DA053941-01,phs002525.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims and methodology outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We used data from adult HD patients treated at an integrated kidney disease company who received a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to investigate suspicion of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection between May 1 and September 1, 2020. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time in patients testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 and those who survived or died within 30 days of first suspicion or positive test date. For each clinical parameter of interest, the difference in average daily changes between COVID-19 positive versus negative group and COVID-19 survivor versus nonsurvivor group was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effects model based on measurements in the 14 days before (i.e., Day -14 to Day 0) Day 0. There were 12,836 HD patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 who received RT-PCR testing (8895 SARS-CoV-2 positive). We observed significantly different trends (p < 0.05) in pre-HD systolic blood pressure (SBP), pre-HD pulse rate, body temperature, ferritin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, albumin, and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. For COVID-19 positive group, we observed significantly different clinical trends (p < 0.05) in pre-HD pulse rate, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and albumin between survivors and nonsurvivors. We also observed that, in the group of survivors, most clinical parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 levels within 60-90 days.

A comparison of US hospitalization rates and epidemiologic features of KD in 2020 to those of precoronavirus disease years has yet to be reported.

KD hospitalizations demonstrated seasonal variation with an annual peak between December and April. A second peak of KD admissions was observed in May 2020. The proportion of KD cases classified as severe increased to 40% in 2020 from 33% during the years 2016-2019 (P < 0.01).

A prospective cohort (n = 831) previously undiagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent serial testing (SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, immunoglobulin G [IgG]) for 6 months. Ninety-three participants (11.2%) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive: 14 (15.1%) asymptomatic, 24 (25.8%) severely symptomatic. Healthcare workers (n = 548) were more likely to become infected (14.2% vs 5.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.3) and severely symptomatic (29.5% vs 6.7%). IgG antibodies were detected after 79% of asymptomatic infections, 89% with mild-moderate symptoms, and 96% with severe symptoms. IgG trajectories after asymptomatic infections (slow increases) differed from symptomatic infections (early peaks within 2 months). Most participants (92%) had persistent IgG responses (median 171 days). In multivariable models, IgG titers were positively associated with symptom severity, certain comorbidities, and hospital work. Dyspnea and neurologic changes (including altered smell/taste) lasted ≥ 120 days in ≥ 10% of affected participants. Prolonged symptoms (frequently more severe) corresponded to higher antibody levels.

Kawasaki disease (KD) shares several clinical features with MIS-C, which prompted the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a mainstay therapy for KD. Both diseases share a robust activation of the innate immune system, including the IL-1 signaling pathway, and IL-1 blockade has been used for the treatment of both MIS-C and KD. The mechanism of action of IVIG in these 2 diseases and the cellular source of IL-1β have not been defined.METHODSThe effects of IVIG on peripheral blood leukocyte populations from patients with MIS-C and KD were examined using flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and live-cell imaging.RESULTSCirculating neutrophils were highly activated in patients with KD and MIS-C and were a major source of IL-1β. Following IVIG treatment, activated IL-1β+ neutrophils were reduced in the circulation. In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3K and NADPH oxidase, but independently of caspase activation.CONCLUSIONSActivated neutrophils expressing IL-1β can be targeted by IVIG, supporting its use in both KD and MIS-C to ameliorate inflammation.FUNDINGPatient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; NIH; American Asthma Foundation; American Heart Association; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIGMS; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation.","Apoptosis|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Cell Death|Cell Lineage|Child|Child, Preschool|Fas Ligand Protein|Female|Humans|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Infant|Innate immunity|Interleukin-1beta|Leukocyte Count|Male|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Neutrophil Activation|Neutrophils|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome","Zhu, Yanfang P|Shamie, Isaac|Lee, Jamie C|Nowell, Cameron J|Peng, Weiqi|Angulo, Shiela|Le, Linh Nn|Liu, Yushan|Miao, Huilai|Xiong, Hainan|Pena, Cathleen J|Moreno, Elizabeth|Griffis, Eric|Labou, Stephanie G|Franco, Alessandra|Broderick, Lori|Hoffman, Hal M|Shimizu, Chisato|Lewis, Nathan E|Kanegaye, John T|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Burns, Jane C|Croker, Ben A|",The Journal of clinical investigation,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2021,HD105590,1R61HD105590-01,phs002553.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses the immune response to IVIG in Kawasaki Disease (KD) and MIS-C, which are both conditions addressed in the funding opportunity and grant abstract.

Traditional disease diagnostic methods such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) require multiple steps, trained technicians, and long turnaround time that may worsen the disease surveillance and pandemic control. In sight of this situation, a rapid, one-step, easy-to-use, and high-accuracy diagnostic platform will be valuable for future epidemic control, especially for regions with scarce medical resources. Herein, we report a magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) platform for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biomarkers: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This technique monitors the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses their higher harmonics as a measure of the nanoparticles' binding states. By anchoring polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) onto MNP surfaces, these nanoparticles function as nanoprobes to specifically bind to target analytes (SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in this work) and form nanoparticle clusters. This binding event causes detectable changes in higher harmonics and allows for quantitative and qualitative detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. We have achieved detection limits of 1.56 nM (equivalent to 125 fmole) and 12.5 nM (equivalent to 1 pmole) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. This MPS platform combined with the one-step, wash-free, nanoparticle clustering-based assay method is intrinsically versatile and allows for the detection of a variety of other disease biomarkers by simply changing the surface functional groups on MNPs.","COVID-19|Cluster Analysis|Humans|Nanoparticles|Nucleocapsid Proteins|SARS-CoV-2|Spectrum Analysis|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|disease diagnostics|magnetic nanoparticle|magnetic particle spectroscopy|nucleocapsid protein|spike protein","Wu, Kai|Chugh, Vinit Kumar|D Krishna, Venkatramana|di Girolamo, Arturo|Wang, Yongqiang Andrew|Saha, Renata|Liang, Shuang|Cheeran, Maxim C-J|Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article,2021,DE030832,1R42DE030832-01,phs002572.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,4.5,"The publication abstract describes a novel diagnostic method using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

This method, termed Cellphone-based amplification-free system with CRISPR/CAS-dependent enzymatic (CASCADE) assay, relies on mobile phone imaging of a catalase-generated gas bubble signal within a microfluidic channel and does not require any external hardware optical attachments. Upon specific detection of a SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcribed DNA/RNA heteroduplex target (orf1ab) by the ribonucleoprotein complex, the transcleavage collateral activity of the Cas12a protein on a Catalase:ssDNA probe triggers the bubble signal on the system. High analytical sensitivity in signal detection without previous target amplification (down to 50 copies µL<sup>-1</sup>) is observed in spiked samples, in ≈71 min from sample input to results readout.

Therefore, the development of a sensing platform where the gold nanorod morphology (i.e., aspect ratio) is modulated in response to an analyte holds promise in achieving ultralow detection limits. Here, we use a dithiol peptide as an enzyme substrate during nanorod growth. The sensing mechanism is enabled by the substrate design, where the dithiol peptide contains an enzyme cleavage site in-between cysteine amino acids. When cleaved, the peptide dramatically impacts gold nanorod growth and the resulting optical properties. We demonstrate that the optical response can be correlated with enzyme concentration and achieve a 45 pM limit of detection. Furthermore, we extend this sensing platform to colorimetrically detect tumor-associated inhibitors in a biologically relevant medium.

We examined if use of shared chairs in outpatient hemodialysis associates with a risk for indirect patient-to-patient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We used data from adults treated at 2,600 hemodialysis facilities in United States between February 1st and June 8th, 2020. We performed a retrospective case-control study matching each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient (case) to a non-SARS-CoV-2 patient (control) treated in the same dialysis shift. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, race, facility, shift date, and treatment count. For each case-control pair, we traced backward 14 days to assess possible prior exposure from a 'shedding' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient who sat in the same chair immediately before the case or control. Conditional logistic regression models tested whether chair exposure after a shedding SARS-CoV-2 positive patient conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the immediate subsequent patient. Among 170,234 hemodialysis patients, 4,782 (2.8 %) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean age 64 years, 44 % female). Most facilities (68.5 %) had 0 to 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient. We matched 2,379 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases to 2,379 non-SARS-CoV-2 controls; 1.30 % (95 %CI 0.90 %, 1.87 %) of cases and 1.39 % (95 %CI 0.97 %, 1.97 %) of controls were exposed to a chair previously sat in by a shedding SARS-CoV-2 patient. Transmission risk among cases was not significantly different from controls (OR = 0.94; 95 %CI 0.57 to 1.54; p = 0.80). Results remained consistent in adjusted and sensitivity analyses.

However, most existing exosome-based analytical sensing methods struggle to achieve high sensitivity and high selectivity simultaneously. In this work, we present an electrochemical micro-aptasensor for the highly sensitive detection of exosomes by integrating a micropatterned electrochemical aptasensor and a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) signal amplification method. Specifically, exosomes are enriched on CD63 aptamer-functionalized electrodes and then recognized by HCR products with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) attached using EpCAM aptamers as bridges. Subsequently, the current signal that is generated through the enzyme reaction between the HRP enzyme and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> directly correlates to the amount of bound HRP on the HCR products and thus to the number of target exosomes. By introducing anti-EpCAM aptamers, micro-aptasensors can detect cancerous exosomes with high specificity. Due to the micropatterned electrodes and HCR dual-amplification strategy, the micro-aptasensors achieve a linear detection response for a wide range of exosome concentrations from 2.5×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>7</sup> exosomes/mL, with a detection limit of 5×10<sup>2</sup> exosomes/mL.

The chemokine receptor CCR6, but not CCR9, was highly expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ but not on CD8+ T cells. Only two of 10 KD subjects showed a T-cell response to CCC. Enumeration of myeloid APCs revealed low cell precursors in MIS-C subjects compared to KD. In summary, children with MIS-C mount a normal T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 with no apparent relationship to antecedent CCC exposure. Low numbers of tolerogenic myeloid DCs may impair their anti-inflammatory response.","Adolescent|CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes|CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes|COVID-19|Child|Child, Preschool|Female|Humans|Immunity, Cellular|Immunologic Memory|Infant|Kawasaki disease|Male|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|SARS-CoV-2|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|T cells|T-cell memory|multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)","Hsieh, Li-En|Grifoni, Alba|Sidney, John|Shimizu, Chisato|Shike, Hiroko|Ramchandar, Nanda|Moreno, Elizabeth|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Burns, Jane C|Franco, Alessandra",European journal of immunology,"Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,HD105590,1R61HD105590-01,phs002553.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses the characterization of T-cell responses in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease children, which aligns with the research objectives of the funding opportunity and grant abstract.

The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973 SNVs, of which 548 were ""novel"" SNVs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17<sup>th</sup> June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However, between 17<sup>th</sup> of June 2020 and 20<sup>th</sup> November 2020, almost half of the novel SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.",COVID-19|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|High-throughput sequencing|Humans|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Surveillance|Wastewater|Wastewater-based epidemiology,"Fontenele, Rafaela S|Kraberger, Simona|Hadfield, James|Driver, Erin M|Bowes, Devin|Holland, LaRinda A|Faleye, Temitope O C|Adhikari, Sangeet|Kumar, Rahul|Inchausti, Rosa|Holmes, Wydale K|Deitrick, Stephanie|Brown, Philip|Duty, Darrell|Smith, Ted|Bhatnagar, Aruni|Yeager, Ray A|Holm, Rochelle H|von Reitzenstein, Natalia Hoogesteijn|Wheeler, Elliott|Dixon, Kevin|Constantine, Tim|Wilson, Melissa A|Lim, Efrem S|Jiang, Xiaofang|Halden, Rolf U|Scotch, Matthew|Varsani, Arvind",Water research,Journal Article,2021,LM013129,3U01LM013129-02S1,phs002527.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims and methodology outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.","Antibodies, Viral|Binding Sites|Breast milk|COVID-19|Dried Blood Spot Testing|Humans|Microsampling|Seroepidemiology|Vaccination","Datta, Pratik|Ukey, Rahul|Bruiners, Natalie|Honnen, William|Carayannopoulos, Mary O|Reichman, Charles|Choudhary, Alok|Onyuka, Alberta|Handler, Deborah|Guerrini, Valentina|Mishra, Pankaj K|Dewald, Hannah K|Lardizabal, Alfred|Lederer, Leeba|Leiser, Aliza L|Hussain, Sabiha|Jagpal, Sugeet K|Radbel, Jared|Bhowmick, Tanaya|Horton, Daniel B|Barrett, Emily S|Xie, Yingda L|Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, Patricia|Weiss, Stanley H|Woortman, Melissa|Parmar, Heta|Roy, Jason|Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria|Blaser, Martin J|Carson, Jeffrey L|Panettieri, Reynold A|Libutti, Steven K|Raymond, Henry F|Pinter, Abraham|Gennaro, Maria Laura",Journal of immunological methods,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2021,HD105619,1R61HD105619-01,phs002569.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,3.5,"The publication abstract describes an antibody binding assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

Existing methods are either done in an ad hoc fashion, such as model recalibration or focus on studying the relationship between predictors and outcome and less so for the purpose of prediction. In this article, we propose a dynamic logistic state space model to continuously update the parameters whenever new information becomes available. The proposed model allows for both time-varying and time-invariant coefficients. The varying coefficients are modeled using smoothing splines to account for their smooth trends over time. The smoothing parameters are objectively chosen by maximum likelihood. The model is updated using batch data accumulated at prespecified time intervals, which allows for better approximation of the underlying binomial density function. In the simulation, we show that the new model has significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.

Previously developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) point-of-care devices are based on the specific molecular recognition using subunit protein antibodies and protein receptors that selectively capture the viral proteins. However, these necessarily involve complex and lengthy development and processing times and are notoriously prone to a loss of biological activity upon sensor immobilization and device interfacing, potentially limiting their use in applications at scale. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for nanoparticle corona interfaces that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any antibody and receptor design. Our nanosensor constructs consist of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)─phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that recognize the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 using unique three-dimensional (3D) nanosensor interfaces. This results in rapid and label-free nIR fluorescence detection. This antibody-free nanosensor shows up to 50% sensor responses within 5 min of viral protein injections with limit of detection (LOD) values of 48 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively.

Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases.

Central to our ability to successfully tackle these diseases is the need to quickly detect the causative virus and neutralize it efficiently. Here we present the rational design of DNA nanostructures to inhibit dengue virus infection. The designer DNA nanostructure (DDN) can bind to complementary epitopes on antigens dispersed across the surface of a viral particle. Since these antigens are arranged in a defined geometric pattern that is unique to each virus, the structure of the DDN is designed to mirror the spatial arrangement of antigens on the viral particle, providing very high viral binding avidity. We describe how available structural data can be used to identify unique spatial patterns of antigens on the surface of a viral particle. We then present a procedure for synthesizing DDNs using a combination of in silico design principles, self-assembly, and characterization using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of a DDN in inhibiting dengue virus infection via plaque-forming assays. We expect this protocol to take 2-3 d to complete virus antigen pattern identification from existing cryogenic electron microscopy data, ~2 weeks for DDN design, synthesis, and virus binding characterization, and ~2 weeks for DDN cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy assays.","Animals|Antigens, Viral|Antiviral Agents|DNA|Dengue|Dengue Virus|Humans|Microscopy, Atomic Force|Nanostructures|Surface Plasmon Resonance","Ren, Shaokang|Fraser, Keith|Kuo, Lili|Chauhan, Neha|Adrian, Addison T|Zhang, Fuming|Linhardt, Robert J|Kwon, Paul S|Wang, Xing",Nature protocols,Journal Article|Review,2022,AA029348,1U01AA029348-01,phs002573.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,3.5,"The publication abstract discusses the design of DNA nanostructures to inhibit dengue virus infection, which is related to the broader goal of developing novel approaches for viral detection and inhibition.

Here we report detecting increasing frequencies of novel cryptic SARS-CoV-2 lineages not recognized in GISAID's EpiCoV database.

Finally, pseudoviruses containing the spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were resistant to different classes of receptor binding domain neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

Where the pandemic has been controlled, extremely high rates of diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have proven critical, enabling isolation of cases and contact tracing. Recently, diagnostic testing has been supplemented with wastewater measures to evaluate the degree to which communities have infections. Whereas much testing has been done through traditional, centralized, clinical, or environmental laboratory methods, point-of-care testing has proven successful in reducing time to result. As the pandemic progresses and becomes more broadly distributed, further decentralization of diagnostic testing will be helpful to mitigate its spread. This will be particularly both challenging and critical in settings with limited resources due to lack of medical infrastructure and expertise as well as requirements to return results quickly. In this article, we validate the tiny isothermal nucleic acid quantification system (TINY) and a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assay for the point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and also for in-the-field, point-of-collection surveillance of wastewater. The TINY system is portable and designed for use in settings with limited resources. It can be powered by electrical, solar, or thermal energy and is robust against interruptions in services.

Nowadays, commercial devices based on the GMR effect, such as hard-disk drives, biosensors, magnetic field sensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), etc., are available in the market, by virtue of the advances in state-of-the-art thin-film deposition and micro- and nanofabrication techniques. Different types of GMR biosensor arrays with superior sensitivity and robustness are available at a lower cost for a wide variety of biomedical applications. In this paper, we review the recent advances in GMR-based biomedical applications including disease diagnosis, genotyping, food and drug regulation, brain and cardiac mapping, etc. The GMR magnetic multilayer structure, spin valve, and magnetic granular structure, as well as fundamental theories of the GMR effect, are introduced at first. The emerging topic of flexible GMR for wearable biosensing is also included. Different GMR pattern designs, sensor surface functionalization, bioassay strategies, and on-chip accessories for improved GMR performances are reviewed. It is foreseen that combined with the state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, GMR biosensors hold great promise in biomedicine, particularly for point-of-care (POC) disease diagnosis and wearable devices for real-time health monitoring.",Biosensing Techniques|Electronics|GMR|Magnetics|Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems|Wearable Electronic Devices|brain mapping|cardiac mapping|disease diagnosis|flexible sensor|food safety|genotyping,"Wu, Kai|Tonini, Denis|Liang, Shuang|Saha, Renata|Chugh, Vinit Kumar|Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article|Review,2022,DE030832,1R42DE030832-01,phs002572.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,3.5,"The publication abstract discusses giant magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensors and their applications in various biomedical fields, including disease diagnosis and wearable devices.

Analysis of these samples can be employed for noninvasive surveillance of infectious diseases. To evaluate the efficacy of environmental surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for predicting COVID-19 cases in a college dormitory. Using a prospective experimental design, air, surface swabs, and wastewater samples were collected from a college dormitory from March to May 2021. Students were randomly screened for COVID-19 during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples was concentrated with electronegative filtration and quantified using Volcano 2 <sup>nd</sup> Generation-qPCR. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the associations between time-lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases. This study was conducted in a residential dormitory at the University of Miami, Coral Gables campus, FL, USA. The dormitory housed about 500 students. Students from the dormitory were randomly screened, for COVID-19 for 2-3 days / week while entering or exiting the dormitory. Clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases were of our main interest. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples was an indicator of the presence of local COVID-19 cases in the dormitory, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the environmental samples several days prior to the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 genomic footprints were detected in air, surface swab and wastewater samples on 52 (63.4%), 40 (50.0%) and 57 (68.6%) days, respectively, during the study period. On 19 (24%) of 78 days SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three sample types.

However, the prediction efficiency varied by sample type: best prediction by air samples, followed by wastewater and surface swab samples. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected in these samples even on days without any reported cases of COVID-19, suggesting underreporting of COVID-19 cases.<b>Meaning:</b> SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in environmental samples several days prior to clinical reporting of COVID-19 cases.

For example, tests that measure the ability to identify odors may confound sensory performance with memory recall, verbal ability, and past experience with the odor. Conversely, threshold-based tests typically avoid these issues, but are labor intensive. Additionally, many commercially available olfactory tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in a short wellness visit or other broad clinical assessment. We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T) -- a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odor-delivery card -- in a non-clinical sample of individuals (n=534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH. Participants successfully completed the test in under 3 min with a false alarm rate of 9.6% and a test-retest reliability of 0.61. Odor detection thresholds differed by sex (~3.2-fold) and between the youngest and oldest age groups (~8.7-fold), consistent with prior work. In an exploratory analysis, we failed to observe evidence of detection threshold differences between participants who reported a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not.

In general, DNA computation is conducted in individual tubes, is slow in generating chemical outputs in response to chemical inputs and requires fluorescence readout. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for DNA computation where the chemical input is processed and transduced into a mechanical output using dynamic DNA-based motors operating far from equilibrium. We show that DNA-based motors with onboard logic (DMOLs) can perform Boolean functions (NOT, YES, AND and OR) with 15 min readout times. Because DMOLs are micrometre-sized, massive arrays of DMOLs that are identical or uniquely encoded by size and refractive index can be multiplexed and perform motor-to-motor communication on the same chip. Finally, DMOL computational outputs can be detected using a conventional smartphone camera, thus transducing chemical information into the electronic domain in a facile manner, suggesting potential applications.","Computers, Molecular|DNA|Fluorescence|Logic","Piranej, Selma|Bazrafshan, Alisina|Salaita, Khalid",Nature nanotechnology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2022,AA029345,1U01AA029345-01,phs002744.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,4.0,"The publication abstract describes the development of DNA-based molecular motors with onboard logic, which can perform Boolean functions and be read out using a smartphone camera.

Here we show that 30% of adults with COVID-19 had autoantibodies against the lung antigen KCNRG, and 34% had antibodies to the SLE-associated Smith-D3 protein. Children with COVID-19 rarely had autoantibodies; one of 59 children had GAD65 autoantibodies associated with acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes. While autoantibodies associated with SLE/Sjögren's syndrome (Ro52, Ro60, and La) and/or autoimmune gastritis (gastric ATPase) were detected in 74% (40/54) of MIS-C patients, further analysis of these patients and of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), showed that the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was largely responsible for detection of these autoantibodies in both groups of patients. Monitoring <i>in vivo</i> decay of the autoantibodies in MIS-C children showed that the IVIG-derived Ro52, Ro60, and La autoantibodies declined to undetectable levels by 45-60 days, but gastric ATPase autoantibodies declined more slowly requiring >100 days until undetectable. Further testing of IgG and/or IgA antibodies against a subset of potential targets identified by published autoantigen array studies of MIS-C failed to detect autoantibodies against most (16/18) of these proteins in patients with MIS-C who had not received IVIG. However, Troponin C2 and KLHL12 autoantibodies were detected in 2 of 20 and 1 of 20 patients with MIS-C, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that IVIG therapy may be a confounding factor in autoantibody measurements in MIS-C and that antibodies against antigens associated with autoimmune diseases or other human proteins are uncommon in MIS-C.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing|Adenosine Triphosphatases|Adult|Autoantibodies|Autoantigens|Autoimmune Diseases|Autoimmunity|COVID-19|Child|Humans|IVIG|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic|MIS-C multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children|Ribonucleoproteins|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|autoantibodies|autoimmunity","Burbelo, Peter D|Castagnoli, Riccardo|Shimizu, Chisato|Delmonte, Ottavia M|Dobbs, Kerry|Discepolo, Valentina|Lo Vecchio, Andrea|Guarino, Alfredo|Licciardi, Francesco|Ramenghi, Ugo|Rey-Jurado, Emma|Vial, Cecilia|Marseglia, Gian Luigi|Licari, Amelia|Montagna, Daniela|Rossi, Camillo|Montealegre Sanchez, Gina A|Barron, Karyl|Warner, Blake M|Chiorini, John A|Espinosa, Yazmin|Noguera, Loreani|Dropulic, Lesia|Truong, Meng|Gerstbacher, Dana|Mató, Sayonara|Kanegaye, John|Tremoulet, Adriana H||Eisenstein, Eli M|Su, Helen C|Imberti, Luisa|Poli, Maria Cecilia|Burns, Jane C|Notarangelo, Luigi D|Cohen, Jeffrey I",Frontiers in immunology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,HD105590,1R61HD105590-01,phs002553.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.5,"The publication abstract discusses the presence of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C, particularly focusing on how IVIG therapy may influence these antibody levels.

We show that peptides with specific repetitions of defined amino acids (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., arginine, histidine, or phenylalanine) can induce assembly and coalescence of the AgNPs (20 nm) into a hyperbranched structure (AgFSs) (∼2 μm). The dynamic process of this assembly was systematically investigated, and the extinction of the nanostructures can be modulated from 400 to 600 nm by varying the peptide sequences and molar ratio. According to this rationale, two strategies of SARS-CoV-2 detection were investigated. The activity of the main protease (Mpro) involved in SARS-CoV-2 was validated with a peptide substrate that can bridge the AgNPs after the proteolytic cleavage. A sub-nanomolar limit of detection (0.5 nM) and the capacity to distinguish by the naked eye in a wide concentration range (1.25-30 nM) were achieved.

However, the development of exosome-encapsulated drug nanocarriers is limited by low drug loading efficiencies and/or complex, time-consuming drug loading processes.

However, nanomaterial identification and classification are dependent on the image resolution, the image field of view, and the processing time. Optical microscopes are one of the most widely utilized technologies in laboratories across the world, due to their nondestructive abilities to identify and classify critical micro-sized objects and processes, but identifying and classifying critical nano-sized objects and processes with a conventional microscope are outside of its capabilities, due to the diffraction limit of the optics and small field of view. To overcome these challenges of nanomaterial identification and classification, we developed an intelligent nanoscope that combines machine learning and microsphere array-based imaging to: (1) surpass the diffraction limit of the microscope objective with microsphere imaging to provide high-resolution images; (2) provide large field-of-view imaging without the sacrifice of resolution by utilizing a microsphere array; and (3) rapidly classify nanomaterials using a deep convolution neural network. The intelligent nanoscope delivers more than 46 magnified images from a single image frame so that we collected more than 1000 images within 2 seconds. Moreover, the intelligent nanoscope achieves a 95% nanomaterial classification accuracy using 1000 images of training sets, which is 45% more accurate than without the microsphere array. The intelligent nanoscope also achieves a 92% bacteria classification accuracy using 50 000 images of training sets, which is 35% more accurate than without the microsphere array. This platform accomplished rapid, accurate detection and classification of nanomaterials with miniscule size differences.

The mesmerizing properties of MOFs, especially the extensive and tunable porosity and chemical selectivity, also make them an excellent candidate class as chemo-sensory materials. Moreover, MOF-based sensors have attracted considerable attention in the past decade. Recent literature reviews focused on the progress of MOF-based electronic sensors and luminescent MOF sensors, while sensors exploiting the dielectric properties (refractive index) of MOFs were also demonstrated and discussed very recently. The motivation of this report is to provide, for the first time, a general review on such MOF sensors with a particular focus on miniature optical fiber (OF) based MOF sensors and to demonstrate the promising potential of MOFs as dielectric coatings on OF for highly sensitive chemical sensing. The fundamental principle of OF-MOF sensors relies on the tunability of the refractive index of a MOF, which is dependent on the amount and type of adsorbed guest molecules in the MOF pores.

Up to 30% of patients develop coronary artery abnormalities, which are reduced with early treatment. Timely diagnosis of KD is challenging but may become more straightforward with the recent discovery of a whole-blood host response classifier that discriminates KD patients from patients with other febrile conditions. Here, we bridged this microarray-based classifier to a clinically applicable quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay: the Kawasaki Disease Gene Expression Profiling (KiDs-GEP) classifier. We designed and optimized a qRT-PCR assay and applied it to a subset of samples previously used for the classifier discovery to reweight the original classifier. The performance of the KiDs-GEP classifier was comparable to the original classifier with a cross-validated area under the ROC curve of 0.964 [95% CI: 0.924-1.00] vs 0.992 [95% CI: 0.978-1.00], respectively. Both classifiers demonstrated similar trends over various disease conditions, with the clearest distinction between individuals diagnosed with KD vs viral infections. We successfully bridged the microarray-based classifier into the KiDs-GEP classifier, a more rapid and more cost-efficient qRT-PCR assay, bringing a diagnostic test for KD closer to the hospital clinical laboratory. A diagnostic test is needed for Kawasaki disease and is currently not available.

Despite the numerous benefits, sources of variability in sample storage, handling, and processing methods can make WBE data difficult to generalize. We performed an experiment to determine sources of variability in WBE data including the impact of storage time, handling, and processing techniques on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater influent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in North Carolina over 19 days. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration in influent samples held at 4°C did not degrade significantly over the 19-day experiment. Heat pasteurization did not significantly impact the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 at two of the three WWTP but did reduce viral recovery at the WWTP with the smallest population size served. On each processing date, one filter from each sample was processed immediately while a replicate filter was frozen at -80°C. Once processed, filters previously frozen were found to contain slightly higher concentrations (<0.2 log copies/L) than their immediately processed counterparts, indicating freezing filters is a viable method for delayed quantification and may even improve recovery at WWTP with low viral concentrations. Investigation of factors contributing to variability during sample processing indicated that analyst experience level contributed significantly (p<0.001) to accepted droplet generation while extraction efficiency and reverse transcription efficiency contributed significantly (p<0.05) to day-to-day SARS-CoV-2 variability. This study provides valuable practical information for minimizing decay and/or loss of SARS CoV-2 in wastewater influent while adhering to safety procedures, promoting efficient laboratory workflows, and accounting for sources of variability.","COVID-19|Humans|Pandemics|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","Beattie, Rachelle E|Blackwood, A Denene|Clerkin, Thomas|Dinga, Carly|Noble, Rachel T",PloS one,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2022,DA053899,1U01DA053899-01,phs002729.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,4.5,"The publication addresses the challenges in sample handling and variability in WBE, which aligns with the funding opportunity's aim to optimize wastewater-based testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Efforts have been made to use the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to predict the infected population within each sewershed using a multivariable regression approach. However, reported clear and sustained variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral load among treatment facilities receiving industrial wastewater have made clinical prediction challenging. Several classes of molecules released by regional industries and manufacturing facilities, particularly the food processing industry, can significantly suppress the SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater by breaking down the lipid-bilayer of the membranes. Therefore, a systematic ranking process in conjugation with metabolomic analysis was developed to identify the wastewater treatment facilities exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 suppression and identify and quantify the chemicals suppressing the SARS-COV-2 signals. By ranking the viral load per diagnosed case among the sewersheds, we successfully identified the wastewater treatment facilities in Missouri, USA that exhibit SARS-CoV-2 suppression (significantly lower than 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> gene copies/reported case) and determined their suppression rates. Through both untargeted global chemical profiling and targeted analysis of wastewater samples, 40 compounds were identified as candidates of SARS-CoV-2 signal suppressors. Among these compounds, 14 had higher concentrations in wastewater treatment facilities that exhibited SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression compared to the unsuppressed control facilities. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that 4-nonylphenol, palmitelaidic acid, sodium oleate, and polyethylene glycol dioleate are positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression rates. Suppression activities were further confirmed by incubation studies, and the suppression kinetics for each bioactive compound were determined. According to the results of these experiments, bioactive molecules in wastewater can significantly reduce the stability of SARS-CoV-2 genetic marker signals. Based on the concentrations of these chemical suppressors, a correction factor could be developed to achieve more reliable and unbiased surveillance results for wastewater treatment facilities that receive wastewater from similar industries.","COVID-19|Detergents|Humans|Metabolomics|RNA, Viral|SARS-COV-2 suppression|SARS-CoV-2|Surfactants|Wastewater|Wastewater surveillance|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","Bayati, Mohamed|Hsieh, Hsin-Yeh|Hsu, Shu-Yu|Li, Chenhui|Rogers, Elizabeth|Belenchia, Anthony|Zemmer, Sally A|Blanc, Todd|LePage, Cindy|Klutts, Jessica|Reynolds, Melissa|Semkiw, Elizabeth|Johnson, Hwei-Yiing|Foley, Trevor|Wieberg, Chris G|Wenzel, Jeff|Lyddon, Terri|LePique, Mary|Rushford, Clayton|Salcedo, Braxton|Young, Kara|Graham, Madalyn|Suarez, Reinier|Ford, Anarose|Lei, Zhentian|Sumner, Lloyd|Mooney, Brian P|Wei, Xing|Greenlief, C Michael|Johnson, Marc C|Lin, Chung-Ho",Water research,Journal Article,2022,DA053893,1U01DA053893-01,phs002679.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

PCR testing is generally definitive but expensive, although it is highly sensitive and accurate. Biosensor-based monitoring could be a low-cost, accurate, and non-invasive approach to improve testing capacity. We develop a capacitive hACE2 biosensor for intact SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva.

Truncated hACE2 was used as a biorecognition element and attached to the electrode surface by streptavidin-biotin coupling. Biolayer interferometry was used for qualitative interaction screening of hACE2 with UV-attenuated virions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for signal transduction. Truncated hACE2 binds wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with greater avidity than human coronavirus (common cold virus). The limit of detection (LoD) is estimated to be 2,960 copies/ml. The detection process usually takes less than 30 min.

Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater is critical for interpreting the viral loads, comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds, and identifying the vulnerable communities. In this study, five population biomarkers, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), creatinine (CRE), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), caffeine (CAF) and its metabolite paraxanthine (PARA) were investigated and validated for their utility in normalizing the SARS-CoV-2 loads through two normalizing approaches using the data from 64 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Missouri. Their utility in assessing the real-time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated. The best performing candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized SARS-CoV-2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the City of Columbia, Missouri, a university town with a constantly fluctuating population. Our results showed that, except CRE, the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population of the given WWTP. Among selected biomarkers, PARA is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the SARS-CoV-2 load per capita due to its high accuracy, low variability, and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater. It also demonstrated its excellent utility for real-time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater. In addition, the viral loads normalized by the PARA-estimated population significantly improved the correlation (rho=0.5878, p < 0.05) between SARS-CoV-2 load per capita and case numbers per capita.

Hemodialysis patients from four dialysis centers were recruited between June 2021 and February 2022. Each patient provided a median of six serum samples. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against wild type (WT) or Omicron were measured using the GenScript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit.

For patients with MIS-C, the same data were collected from patients between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021, at Rady Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford (CT, USA), and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CA, USA). We trained a two-stage model consisting of feedforward neural networks to distinguish between patients with MIS-C and those without and then those with Kawasaki disease and other febrile illnesses. After internally validating the algorithm using stratified tenfold cross-validation, we incorporated a conformal prediction framework to tag patients with erroneous data or distribution shifts. We finally externally validated KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C enrolled between April 22, 2020, and July 21, 2021, from Boston Children's Hospital (MA, USA), Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals. 1517 patients diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital between Jan 1, 2009, and June 7, 2021, with MIS-C (n=69), Kawasaki disease (n=775), or other febrile illnesses (n=673) were identified for internal validation, with an additional 16 patients with MIS-C included from Connecticut Children's Medical Center and 50 from Children's Hospital Los Angeles between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021. KIDMATCH achieved a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve during internal validation of 98·8% (IQR 98·0-99·3) in the first stage and 96·0% (95·6-97·2) in the second stage. We externally validated KIDMATCH on 175 patients with MIS-C from Boston Children's Hospital (n=50), Children's National Hospital (n=42), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals (n=83). External validation of KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C correctly classified 76 of 81 patients (94% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from 14 hospitals in the CHARMS Study Group consortium, 47 of 49 patients (96% accuracy, one rejected by conformal prediction) from Boston Children's Hospital, and 36 of 40 patients (90% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from Children's National Hospital. KIDMATCH has the potential to aid front-line clinicians to distinguish between MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses to allow prompt treatment and prevent severe complications.

The key for improving the survival rate lies in reliable screening and early diagnosis. Existing techniques including barium-meal gastric photofluorography and upper endoscopy can be costly and time-consuming and are thus impractical for population screening. We look instead for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, currently also referred as exosomes) sized ⌀ 30-150 nm as a candidate. sEVs have attracted a significantly higher level of attention during the past decade or two because of their potentials in disease diagnoses and therapeutics. Here, we report that the composition information of the collective Raman-active bonds inside sEVs of human donors obtained by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) holds the potential for non-invasive GC detection. SERS was triggered by the substrate of gold nanopyramid arrays we developed previously. A machine learning-based spectral feature analysis algorithm was developed for objectively distinguishing the cancer-derived sEVs from those of the non-cancer sub-population. sEVs from the tissue, blood, and saliva of GC patients and non-GC participants were collected (<i>n</i> = 15 each) and analyzed. The algorithm prediction accuracies were reportedly 90, 85, and 72%. ""Leave-a-pair-of-samples out"" validation was further performed to test the clinical potential. The area under the curve of each receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96, 0.91, and 0.65 in tissue, blood, and saliva, respectively.

Herein, we firstly summarized the designs of MNPs from the perspectives of materials and physicochemical properties tailored for biomedical applications. Magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), first reported in 2006, has flourished as an independent platform for many biological and biomedical applications. It has been extensively reported as a versatile platform for a variety of bioassays along with the artificially designed MNPs, where the MNPs serve as magnetic nanoprobes to specifically probe target analytes from fluid samples.

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, nucleic acids, and so forth. Herein, we report a modified version of the MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). We first demonstrated the performance of this MPS system for bioassay-related applications. Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a model, we have achieved a detection limit of 125 nM (equal to 5 pmole) for detecting spike protein molecules in the liquid phase. In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration-dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin were also investigated. Results show that by using a lower concentration/ amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to a lower concentration/amount of target analytes.

The research evaluates the efficacy of environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air, surface swabs and wastewater to predict COVID-19 cases. Using a prospective experimental design, air, surface swabs, and wastewater samples were collected from a college dormitory housing roughly 500 students from March to May 2021 at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL. Students were randomly screened for COVID-19 during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 concentration in environmental samples was quantified using Volcano 2nd Generation-qPCR. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the associations between time-lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples and COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in air, surface swab and wastewater samples on 52 (63.4 %), 40 (50.0 %) and 57 (68.6 %) days, respectively.

One such protocol involves sample clarification by size fractionation using either low-speed centrifugation to produce a clarified supernatant or membrane filtration to produce an initial filtrate depleted of solids, eukaryotes and bacterial present in wastewater (WW), followed by concentration of virus particles by ultrafiltration of the above. While this approach has been successful in identifying viruses from WW, it assumes that majority of the viruses of interest should be present in the fraction obtained by ultrafiltration of the initial filtrate, with negligible loss of viral particles and viral diversity. We used WW samples collected in a population of ~700,000 in southwest USA between October 2019 and March 2021, targeting three non-enveloped viruses (enteroviruses [EV], canine picornaviruses [CanPV], and human adenovirus 41 [Ad41]), to evaluate whether size fractionation of WW prior to ultrafiltration leads to appreciable differences in the virus presence and diversity determined. We showed that virus presence or absence in WW samples in both portions (filter trapped solids [FTS] and filtrate) are not consistent with each other. We also found that in cases where virus was detected in both fractions, virus diversity (or types) captured either in FTS or filtrate were not consistent with each other.

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitutions. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from long-term patient infections or animal reservoirs.

However, extracting and finding useful image features from CXRs demand a heavy workload for radiologists. The aim of this study was to design a novel multiple-inputs (MI) convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of COVID-19 and extraction of critical regions from CXRs. We also investigated the effect of the number of inputs on the performance of our new MI-CNN model. A total of 6205 CXR images (including 3021 COVID-19 CXRs and 3184 normal CXRs) were used to test our MI-CNN models. CXRs could be evenly segmented into different numbers (2, 4, and 16) of individual regions. Each region could individually serve as one of the MI-CNN inputs. The CNN features of these MI-CNN inputs would then be fused for COVID-19 classification. More importantly, the contributions of each CXR region could be evaluated through assessing the number of images that were accurately classified by their corresponding regions in the testing data sets. In both the whole-image and left- and right-lung region of interest (LR-ROI) data sets, MI-CNNs demonstrated good efficiency for COVID-19 classification. In particular, MI-CNNs with more inputs (2-, 4-, and 16-input MI-CNNs) had better efficiency in recognizing COVID-19 CXRs than the 1-input CNN. Compared to the whole-image data sets, the efficiency of LR-ROI data sets showed approximately 4% lower accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision (over 91%). In considering the contributions of each region, one of the possible reasons for this reduced performance was that nonlung regions (eg, region 16) provided false-positive contributions to COVID-19 classification. The MI-CNN with the LR-ROI data set could provide a more accurate evaluation of the contribution of each region and COVID-19 classification. Additionally, the right-lung regions had higher contributions to the classification of COVID-19 CXRs, whereas the left-lung regions had higher contributions to identifying normal CXRs. Overall, MI-CNNs could achieve higher accuracy with an increasing number of inputs (eg, 16-input MI-CNN).

Variations in technical methodologies, coupled with inter-individual variability may reduce study reproducibility and generalizability. Another barrier facing salivary miRNA biomarker research is a lack of recognized ""control miRNAs"". In one of the largest studies of human salivary miRNA to date (922 healthy individuals), we utilized 1225 saliva samples to quantify variability in miRNA expression resulting from aligner selection (Bowtie1 vs. Bowtie2), saliva collection method (expectorated vs. swabbed), RNA stabilizer (presence vs. absence), and individual biological factors (sex, age, body mass index, exercise, caloric intake). Differential expression analyses revealed that absence of RNA stabilizer introduced the greatest variability, followed by differences in methods of collection and aligner. Biological factors generally affected a smaller number of miRNAs. We also reported coefficients of variations for 643 miRNAs consistently present in saliva, highlighting several salivary miRNAs to serve as reference genes. Thus, the results of this analysis can be used by researchers to optimize parameters of salivary miRNA measurement, exclude miRNAs confounded by numerous biologic factors, and identify appropriate miRNA controls.",Biomarkers|Humans|MicroRNAs|Reproducibility of Results|Saliva|biomarker|housekeeping|miRNA|salivary|stabilizer,"Sullivan, Rhea|Montgomery, Austin|Scipioni, Anna|Jhaveri, Pooja|Schmidt, Adam T|Hicks, Steven D",Genes,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,HD105610,1R61HD105610-01,phs002549.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,4.0,"The publication abstract discusses factors impacting microRNA expression in human saliva, which is directly relevant to the grant's focus on using salivary biomarkers to predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2.

Such fingerprints can be useful for comparing microbial niches for environmental research, as well as for applications within forensic science and public health. To determine the regional specificity for environmental metagenomes, we examined 4305 shotgun-sequenced samples from the MetaSUB Consortium dataset-the most extensive public collection of urban microbiomes, spanning 60 different cities, 30 countries, and 6 continents. We were able to identify city-specific microbial fingerprints using supervised machine learning (SML) on the taxonomic classifications, and we also compared the performance of ten SML classifiers. We then further evaluated the five algorithms with the highest accuracy, with the city and continental accuracy ranging from 85-89% to 90-94%, respectively. Thereafter, we used these results to develop Cassandra, a random-forest-based classifier that identifies bioindicator species to aid in fingerprinting and can infer higher-order microbial interactions at each site. We further tested the Cassandra algorithm on the Tara Oceans dataset, the largest collection of marine-based microbial genomes, where it classified the oceanic sample locations with 83% accuracy.

The AuNPs were first aggregated by attractive forces between the citrate-capped surface and the arginine side chains. We found that the HS-PEG thiol group has a higher affinity for the AuNP surface, thus leading to redispersion and colloidal stability. In turn, there was a robust and obvious color change due to on/off plasmonic coupling. The assemblies' dissociation was directly related to the HS-PEG structural properties such as their size or charge. As an example, HS-PEGs with a molecular weight below 1 kDa could dissociate 100% of the assemblies and restore the exact optical properties of the initial AuNP suspension (prior to the assembly). Surprisingly, the dissociation capacity of HS-PEGs was not affected by the composition of the operating medium and could be performed in complex matrices such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell lysates, or even seawater. The high affinity of thiols for the gold surface encompasses by far the one of endogenous molecules and is thus favored. Moreover, starting with AuNPs already aggregated ensured the absence of a background signal as the dissociation of the assemblies was far from spontaneous. Remarkably, it was possible to dry the AuNP assemblies and solubilize them back with HS-PEGs, improving the colorimetric signal generation. We used this system for protease sensing in biological fluids. Trypsin was chosen as the model enzyme, and highly positively charged peptides were conjugated to HS-PEG molecules as cleavage substrates. The increase of positive charge of the HS-PEG-peptide conjugate quenched the dissociation capacity of the HS-PEG molecules, which could only be restored by the proteolytic cleavage.

The LSPR of nanoparticles can shift in response to changes in the local dielectric environment and produce a color change. This color change can be observed by the naked eye due to the exceptionally large extinction coefficients (10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) of plasmonic nanoparticles. Herein, we investigate the optical shifts (i.e., color change) of three unique gold-silver core-shell nanoparticle structures in response to changes in their dielectric environment upon nanoparticle aggregation. Aggregation is induced by a cysteine-containing peptide that has a sulfhydryl near its N and C termini, which crosslinks nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding proline spacers between the cysteines impacts the degree of aggregation and, ultimately, the color response. Using this information, we construct a colorimetric enzyme assay, where the signal produced from nanoparticle aggregation is modulated by proteolysis. The degree of aggregation and the resulting optical shift can be correlated with enzyme concentration with high linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998).

Influent 24-hour composite wastewater samples were collected from July to December 2020 from two municipal wastewater treatment plants serving different population sizes in Orange and Chatham Counties in North Carolina. After a concentration step via HA filtration, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected and quantified by reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), targeting the N1 and N2 nucleocapsid genes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-ddPCR in 100 % (24/24) and 79 % (19/24) of influent wastewater samples from the larger and smaller plants, respectively. In comparison, viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in 41.7 % (10/24) and 8.3 % (2/24) of samples from the larger and smaller plants, respectively. Positivity rates and method agreement further increased for the RT-qPCR assay when samples with positive signals below the limit of detection were counted as positive.

Institutions rapidly assembled task forces to develop treatment algorithms. At the national/international levels, collaboratives and associations assembled consensus writing groups to draft guidelines. These guidelines and algorithms were initially on the basis of expert opinion and small case series. Some groups used the Delphi approach, and the resultant guidelines often mimicked those for other conditions that resembled MIS-C, like Kawasaki disease (KD). For instance, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a known effective treatment for KD, was recommended for MIS-C. Early in the pandemic many favoured IVIG over steroids as first-line therapy. As evidence evolved so did some guidelines, which now endorse the dual use of IVIG with steroids as first-line therapy. In contrast, withholding immunotherapy became an option for some MIS-C patients with mild symptoms. Herein, we review guidelines and discuss the evidence informing early recommendations, how this has evolved, the role and limitations of expert opinion and observational data, and the importance of leveraging existing research infrastructures, such as the intensive care unit collaborative (Overcoming COVID-19 surveillance registry), and the International Kawasaki Disease Registry. Finally, we discuss strategies to rapidly develop, deploy, and adapt clinical trials evaluating the treatment of such rare conditions in children, which might include alternatives to conventional clinical trial design.

For example, tests that measure the ability to identify odors may confound sensory performance with memory recall, verbal ability, and prior experience with the odor. Conversely, classic threshold-based tests avoid these issues, but are labor intensive. Additionally, many commercially available tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in situations where time is at a premium or self-administration is required. We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T)-a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odorant delivery card-in a non-clinical sample of individuals (n = 534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH. Participants successfully completed the test in under 3 min with a false alarm rate of 7.5% and a test-retest reliability of 0.61. Odor detection thresholds differed by sex (~3.2-fold lower for females) and age (~8.7-fold lower for the youngest versus the oldest age group), consistent with prior studies. In an exploratory analysis, we failed to observe evidence of detection threshold differences between participants who reported a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not. We also found evidence for broad-sense heritability of odor detection thresholds. Together, this study suggests the ArOMa-T can determine odor detection thresholds.

The US FDA approved the first breath test for COVID-19 under emergency use authorization in April 2022. Most breath-based assays measure volatile metabolites exhaled by persons to identify a host response to infection. We hypothesized that the breathprint of COVID-19 fluctuated after Omicron became the primary variant of transmission over the Delta variant. We collected breath samples from 142 persons with and without a confirmed COVID-19 infection during the Delta and Omicron waves. Breath samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we show that based on 63 exhaled compounds, a general COVID-19 model had an accuracy of 0.73 ± 0.06, which improved to 0.82 ± 0.12 when modeling only the Delta wave, and 0.84 ± 0.06 for the Omicron wave. The specificity improved for the Delta and Omicron models (0.79 ± 0.21 and 0.74 ± 0.12, respectively) relative to the general model (0.61 ± 0.13). We report that the volatile signature of COVID-19 in breath differs between the Delta-predominant and Omicron-predominant variant waves, and accuracies improve when samples from these waves are modeled separately rather than as one universal approach.

This study aimed to showcase how wastewater monitoring, once established and accepted by a community, could readily be adapted to respond to newly emerging public health priorities. In this population-based study in Greater Tempe, Arizona, an existing opioid monitoring WBE network was modified to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the analysis of 11 contiguous wastewater catchments. Flow-weighted and time-weighted 24 h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected at each sampling location within the wastewater collection system for 3 days each week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021 (Area 7 and Tempe St Luke's Hospital were added in July, 2020). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the wastewater samples was used to determine the number of genome copies in each catchment. Newly detected clinical cases of COVID-19 by zip code within the City of Tempe, Arizona were reported daily by the Arizona Department of Health Services from May 23, 2020. Maricopa County-level new positive cases, COVID-19-related hospitalisations, deaths, and long-term care facility deaths per day are publicly available and were collected from the Maricopa County Epidemic Curve Dashboard. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 (genome copies per day) measured in wastewater from each catchment were aggregated at the zip code level and city level and compared with the clinically reported data using root mean square error to investigate early warning capability of WBE. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 1556 wastewater samples were analysed. Most locations showed two waves in viral levels peaking in June, 2020, and December, 2020-January, 2021. An additional wave of viral load was seen in catchments close to Arizona State University (Areas 6 and 7) at the beginning of the fall (autumn) semester in late August, 2020. Additionally, an early infection hotspot was detected in the Town of Guadalupe, Arizona, starting the week of May 4, 2020, that was successfully mitigated through targeted interventions. A shift in early warning potential of WBE was seen, from a leading (mean of 8·5 days [SD 2·1], June, 2020) to a lagging (-2·0 days [1·4], January, 2021) indicator compared with newly reported clinical cases. Lessons learned from leveraging an existing neighbourhood-level WBE reporting dashboard include: (1) community buy-in is key, (2) public data sharing is effective, and (3) sub-ZIP-code (postal code) data can help to pinpoint populations at risk, track intervention success in real time, and reveal the effect of local clinical testing capacity on WBE's early warning capability. This successful demonstration of transitioning WBE efforts from opioids to COVID-19 encourages an expansion of WBE to tackle newly emerging and re-emerging threats (eg, mpox and polio).

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) - a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study.

However, there is an absence of quick, population-wide olfactory tests to screen for olfactory disorders. The purpose of this study was to provide a proof-of-concept that SCENTinel 1.1, a rapid, inexpensive, population-wide olfactory test, can discriminate between anosmia (total smell loss), hyposmia (reduced sense of smell), parosmia (distorted odor perception), and phantosmia (odor sensation without a source). Participants were mailed a SCENTinel 1.1 test, which measures odor detection, intensity, identification, and pleasantness, using one of 4 possible odors. Those who completed the test (N = 287) were divided into groups based on their self-reported olfactory function: quantitative olfactory disorder only (anosmia or hyposmia, N = 135), qualitative olfactory disorder only (parosmia and/or phantosmia; N = 86), and normosmia (normal sense of smell; N = 66). SCENTinel 1.1 accurately discriminates quantitative olfactory disorders, qualitative olfactory disorders, and normosmia groups. When olfactory disorders were assessed individually, SCENTinel 1.1 discriminates between hyposmia, parosmia, and anosmia. Participants with parosmia rated common odors less pleasant than those without parosmia. We provide proof-of-concept that SCENTinel 1.1, a rapid smell test, can discriminate quantitative and qualitative olfactory disorders, and is the only direct test to rapidly discriminate parosmia.",Anosmia|COVID-19|Humans|Olfaction Disorders|SARS-CoV-2|Smell|anosmia|hyposmia|parosmia|phantosmia|prediction|smell test,"Hunter, Stephanie R|Hannum, Mackenzie E|Pellegrino, Robert|O'Leary, Maureen A|Rawson, Nancy E|Reed, Danielle R|Dalton, Pamela H|Parma, Valentina",Chemical senses,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2023,DC019578,1U01DC019578-01,phs002699.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims and methodology outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

Although many breath sample collection and analytical methods have been developed for breath analysis, analysis of metabolic VOCs in exhaled breath is still a challenge for clinical application. Many carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath are related to the metabolic processes of diseases. This work reports a method of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) for the analysis of a broad range of carbonyl metabolites in exhaled breath.

The rapid screening and preliminary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection allow for the instant identification of possibly infected individuals and the subsequent mitigation of the disease spread. Herein, the detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals was explored using noninvasive sampling and low-preparatory-work analytical instrumentation. Hand odor samples were obtained from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative individuals. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted from the collected hand odor samples using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was used to develop predictive models using the suspected variant sample subsets. The developed sPLS-DA models performed moderately (75.8% (±0.4) accuracy, 81.8% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity) at distinguishing between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative -individuals based on the VOC signatures alone. Potential markers for distinguishing between infection statuses were preliminarily acquired using this multivariate data analysis.

However, the impact of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Omicron, on the exhaled breath profile and diagnostic accuracy of breath analysis is unknown. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracies of breath analysis on detecting patients with COVID-19 when the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants were most prevalent. This diagnostic study included a cohort of patients who had positive and negative test results for COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between April 2021 and May 2022, which covers the period when the Delta variant was overtaken by Omicron as the major variant. Patients were enrolled through intensive care units and the emergency department at the University of Michigan Health System. Patient breath was analyzed with portable gas chromatography. Different sets of VOC biomarkers were identified that distinguished between COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants) and non-COVID-19 illness. Overall, 205 breath samples from 167 adult patients were analyzed. A total of 77 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [16.1] years; 41 [53.2%] male patients; 13 [16.9%] Black and 59 [76.6%] White patients) had COVID-19, and 91 patients (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [17.1] years; 43 [47.3%] male patients; 11 [12.1%] Black and 76 [83.5%] White patients) had non-COVID-19 illness. Several patients were analyzed over multiple days. Among 94 positive samples, 41 samples were from patients in 2021 infected with the Delta or other variants, and 53 samples were from patients in 2022 infected with the Omicron variant, based on the State of Michigan and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data. Four VOC biomarkers were found to distinguish between COVID-19 (Delta and other 2021 variants) and non-COVID-19 illness with an accuracy of 94.7%. However, accuracy dropped substantially to 82.1% when these biomarkers were applied to the Omicron variant. Four new VOC biomarkers were found to distinguish the Omicron variant and non-COVID-19 illness (accuracy, 90.9%). Breath analysis distinguished Omicron from the earlier variants with an accuracy of 91.5% and COVID-19 (all SARS-CoV-2 variants) vs non-COVID-19 illness with 90.2% accuracy. The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that breath analysis has promise for COVID-19 detection.

However, implementation of wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is limited due to the need for expert staff, expensive equipment, and prolonged processing times. As WBE increases in scope (beyond SARS-CoV-2) and scale (beyond developed regions), there is a need to make WBE processes simpler, cheaper, and faster. We developed an automated workflow based on a simplified method termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP). Our automated workflow takes 40 min from raw wastewater to purified RNA, which is several times faster than conventional WBE methods. The total assay cost per sample/replicate is $6.50 which includes consumables and reagents for concentration, extraction, and RT-qPCR quantification. The assay complexity is reduced significantly, as extraction and concentration steps are integrated and automated. The high recovery efficiency of the automated assay (84.5 ± 25.4%) yielded an improved Limit of Detection (LoD<sub>Automated</sub>=40 copies/mL) compared to the manual process (LoD<sub>Manual</sub>=206 copies/mL), increasing analytical sensitivity. We validated the performance of the automated workflow by comparing it with the manual method using wastewater samples from several locations. The results from the two methods correlated strongly (r = 0.953), while the automated method was shown to be more precise. In 83% of the samples, the automated method showed lower variation between replicates, which is likely due to higher technical errors in the manual process e.g., pipetting.

Here, we report the design, implementation, and characterization of a compact Photonic Resonator Interferometric Scattering Microscope (PRISM) designed for point-of-use environments and applications. The contrast of interferometric scattering microscopy is amplified through a photonic crystal surface, upon which scattered light from an object combines with illumination from a monochromatic source. The use of a photonic crystal substrate for interferemetric scattering microscopy results in reduced requirements for high-intensity lasers or oil-immersion objectives, thus opening a pathway toward instruments that are more suitable for environments outside the optics laboratory. The instrument incorporates two innovative elements that facilitate operation on a desktop in ordinary laboratory environments by users that do not have optics expertise. First, because scattering microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration, we incorporated an inexpensive but effective solution of suspending the instrument's main components from a rigid metal framework using elastic bands, resulting in an average of 28.7 dBV reduction in vibration amplitude compared to an office desk. Second, an automated focusing module based on the principle of total internal reflection maintains the stability of image contrast over time and spatial position.

Factors associated with initial anakinra use (days 0-1) were identified. We compared cases in patients ages 2-20 years receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids versus anakinra plus IVIG and/or glucocorticoids on days 0-1, using inverse probability weighting to balance disease severity. Primary outcomes were vasopressor requirement on day 3 and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction on days 3-4. The secondary outcome was 50% reduction in C-reactive protein on day 3. Among 1,516 MIS-C cases at 44 sites, 193 (13%) patients received anakinra alone or with other immunomodulators as initial treatment (range 0-74% by site).

WBE has been adopted as one of the methods to monitor the spread and population dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but significant challenges remain in the bioinformatic analysis of WBE-derived data. Here, we have developed a new distance metric, CoVdist, and an associated analysis tool that facilitates the application of ordination analysis to WBE data and the identification of viral population changes based on nucleotide variants. We applied these new approaches to a large-scale dataset from 18 cities in nine states of the USA using wastewater collected from July 2021 to June 2022. We found that the trends in the shift between the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 lineages were largely consistent with what was seen in clinical data, but that wastewater analysis offered the added benefit of revealing significant differences in viral population dynamics at the state, city, and even neighborhood scales. We also were able to observe the early spread of variants of concern and the presence of recombinant lineages during the transitions between variants, both of which are challenging to analyze based on clinically-derived viral genomes. The methods outlined here will be beneficial for future applications of WBE to monitor SARS-CoV-2, particularly as clinical monitoring becomes less prevalent.

Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 can shed the virus through the gastrointestinal tract, enabling the quantification of the virus in stool and ultimately in wastewater (WW). Unfortunately, instability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater limits the utility of WBE programs, particularly in remote/rural regions where reliable cold storage and/or rapid shipping may be unavailable. This study examined whether rapid SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction on the day of sample collection could minimize degradation. Importantly, the extraction technology used in these experiments, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), is lightweight, portable, and electricity-free, making it suitable for implementation in remote settings. We demonstrated that immediate RNA extraction followed by ambient storage significantly increased the RNA half-life compared to raw wastewater samples stored at both 4 °C or ambient temperature. Given that RNA degradation negatively impacts both the sensitivity and precision of WBE measurements, efforts must be made to mitigate degradation in order to maximize the potential impact of WBE on public health.","COVID-19|Degradation|Electricity|Humans|RNA stabilization|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Temperature|Wastewater","Torabi, Soroosh|Amirsoleimani, Atena|Dehghan Banadaki, Mohammad|Strike, William Dalton|Rockward, Alexus|Noble, Ann|Liversedge, Matthew|Keck, James W|Berry, Scott M",The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,2023,DA053903,1U01DA053903-01,phs002542.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims and methodology outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

Here, we report the design and characterization of a compact fluorimeter called a ""Virus Pod"" (V-Pod) that enables sensitive self-testing of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. The rechargeable battery-operated device reads the fluorescence generated by Designer DNA Nanostructures (DDN) when they specifically interact with intact SARS-CoV-2 virions. DDNs are net-shaped self-assembling nucleic acid constructs that provide an array of highly specific aptamer-fluorescent quencher duplexes located at precise positions that match the pattern of spike proteins. The room-temperature assay is performed by mixing the test sample with DNA Net sensor in a conventional PCR tube and placing the tube into the V-Pod. Fluorescent signals are generated when multivalent aptamer-spike binding releases fluorescent quenchers, resulting in rapid (5-min) generation of dose-dependent output. The V-Pod instrument performs laser excitation, fluorescence intensity quantitation, and secure transmission of data to an App via Bluetooth™. We show that the V-Pod and DNA Net assay achieves clinically relevant detection limits of 3.92 × 10<sup>3</sup> viral-genome-copies/mL for pseudo-typed wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and 1.84 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 9.69 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 6.99 × 10<sup>4</sup> viral-genome-copies/mL for pathogenic Delta, Omicron, and D614G variants, representing sensitivity similar to laboratory-based PCR.

To date, in the United States more than 8,862 cases of MIS-C have been identified and 72 deaths have occurred. This syndrome typically affects children between the ages of 5-13; 57% are Hispanic/Latino/Black/non-Hispanic, 61% of patients are males and 100% have either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had direct contact with someone with COVID-19. Unfortunately, diagnosis of MIS-C is difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, intensive care admission, and prolonged hospitalization. There is no validated biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of MIS-C. In this study, we used Grating-coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) microarray technology to develop biomarker signatures in pediatric salvia and serum samples from patients with MIS-C in the United States and Colombia. GCFP measures antibody-antigen interactions at individual regions of interest (ROIs) on a gold-coated diffraction grating sensor chip in a sandwich immunoassay to generate a fluorescent signal based on analyte presence within a sample. Using a microarray printer, we designed a first-generation biosensor chip with the capability of capturing 33 different analytes from 80  <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>μ</mi> <mi>L</mi></mrow> </math> of sample (saliva or serum). Here, we show potential biomarker signatures in both saliva and serum samples in six patient cohorts. In saliva samples, we noted occasional analyte outliers on the chip within individual samples and were able to compare those samples to 16S RNA microbiome data. These comparisons indicate differences in relative abundance of oral pathogens within those patients. Microsphere Immunoassay (MIA) of immunoglobulin isotypes was also performed on serum samples and revealed MIS-C patients had several COVID antigen-specific immunoglobulins that were significantly higher than other cohorts, thus identifying potential new targets for the second-generation biosensor chip. MIA also identified additional biomarkers for our second-generation chip, verified biomarker signatures generated on the first-generation chip, and aided in second-generation chip optimization. Interestingly, MIS-C samples from the United States had a more diverse and robust signature than the Colombian samples, which was also illustrated in the MIA cytokine data.

Administrative databases offer an opportunity to conduct generalizable research; however, identifying patients with MIS-C is challenging. We developed and validated algorithms to identify MIS-C hospitalizations in administrative databases. We developed 10 approaches using diagnostic codes and medication billing data and applied them to the Pediatric Health Information System from January 2020 to August 2021. We reviewed medical records at 7 geographically diverse hospitals to compare potential cases of MIS-C identified by algorithms to each participating hospital's list of patients with MIS-C (used for public health reporting). The sites had 245 hospitalizations for MIS-C in 2020 and 358 additional MIS-C hospitalizations through August 2021. One algorithm for the identification of cases in 2020 had a sensitivity of 82%, a low false positive rate of 22%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 78%.

Herein, we present design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called the ""NanoGripper"", that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages evolved in nature. Each NanoGripper finger has three phalanges connected by two flexible and rotatable joints that are bendable in response to binding to other entities. Functions of the NanoGripper have been enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We showcase that the NanoGripper can be engineered to interact with and capture various objects with different dimensions, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. When carrying multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate fluorescent signal enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a sensitive viral biosensor that detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ~ 100 copies/mL, providing RT-PCR equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we use confocal microscopy to visualize how the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, indicating the viral inhibition.

Children presenting with MIS-C to participating hospitals in the United Kingdom and the European Union between April 2020 and April 2021 were prospectively recruited. Whole-blood RNA Sequencing was performed, contrasting the transcriptomes of children with MIS-C (n = 38) to those from children with KD (n = 136), definite bacterial (DB; n = 188) and viral infections (DV; n = 138). Genes significantly differentially expressed (SDE) between MIS-C and comparator groups were identified. Feature selection was used to identify genes that optimally distinguish MIS-C from other diseases, which were subsequently translated into RT-qPCR assays and evaluated in an independent validation set comprising MIS-C (n = 37), KD (n = 19), DB (n = 56), DV (n = 43), and COVID-19 (n = 39). In the discovery set, 5696 genes were SDE between MIS-C and combined comparator disease groups. Five genes were identified as potential MIS-C diagnostic biomarkers (HSPBAP1, VPS37C, TGFB1, MX2, and TRBV11-2), achieving an AUC of 96.8% (95% CI: 94.6%-98.9%) in the discovery set, and were translated into RT-qPCR assays. The RT-qPCR 5-gene signature achieved an AUC of 93.2% (95% CI: 88.3%-97.7%) in the independent validation set when distinguishing MIS-C from KD, DB, and DV.

One of the complexities of this problem lies on the rapid prototyping of new devices and wireless rapid detection of small particles and virus alike. By reducing the complexity of microfluidics microfabrication and using economic materials along with makerspace tools (Kundu et al. 2018) it is possible to provide an affordable solution to both the problems of high-throughput devices and detection technologies. We present the development of a wireless, standalone device and disposable microfluidics chips that rapidly generate parallel readouts for selected, possible virus variants from a nasal or saliva sample, based on motorized and non-motorized microbeads detection, and imaging processing of the motion tracks of these beads in micrometers.

Our pre-registered cross-sectional study design included an online survey in 12 languages with instructions for self-administering chemosensory tests with 10 household items. Between June 2020 and March 2021, 10,953 individuals participated. Of these, 5,225 self-reported a respiratory illness and were grouped based on their reported COVID test results: COVID-positive (COVID+, N = 3,356), COVID-negative (COVID-, N = 602), and COVID unknown for those waiting for a test result (COVID?, N = 1,267). The participants who reported no respiratory illness were grouped by symptoms: sudden smell/taste changes (STC, N = 4,445), other symptoms excluding smell or taste changes (OthS, N = 832), and no symptoms (NoS, N = 416). Taste, smell, and oral irritation intensities and self-assessed abilities were rated on visual analog scales. Compared to the NoS group, COVID+ was associated with a 21% reduction in taste (95% confidence interval (CI): 15-28%), 47% in smell (95% CI: 37-56%), and 17% in oral irritation (95% CI: 10-25%) intensity. There were medium to strong correlations between perceived intensities and self-reported abilities (r = 0.84 for smell, r = 0.68 for taste, and r = 0.37 for oral irritation).

This study aimed to assess the variation in the upper respiratory tract microbiome using saliva specimens in a cohort of individuals with primarily mild to moderate disease. In early 2020, a cohort of 831 adults without known SARS-CoV-2 infection was followed over a six-month period to assess the occurrence and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From this cohort, 81 participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with 57 unexposed counterparts were selected with a total of 748 serial saliva samples were collected for analysis. Total bacterial abundance, composition, population structure, and gene function of the salivary microbiome were measured using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The salivary microbiome remained stable in unexposed individuals over the six-month study period, as evidenced by all measured metrics. Similarly, participants with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection showed microbiome stability throughout and after their infection. However, there were significant reductions in microbiome diversity among SARS-CoV-2-positive participants with severe symptoms early after infection. Over time, the microbiome diversity in these participants showed signs of recovery. These findings demonstrate the resilience of the salivary microbiome in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild to moderate infections did not significantly disrupt the stability of the salivary microbiome, suggesting its ability to maintain its composition and function.

We analyzed 62 wk of data from 19 sites participating in the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network to characterize wastewater metrics around the Delta and Omicron surges. We found that wastewater data identified outbreaks 4 to 5 d before case data (reported on the earlier of the symptom start date or test collection date), on average. At most sites, correlations between wastewater and case data were similar regardless of how wastewater concentrations were normalized and whether calculated with county-level or sewershed-level cases, suggesting that officials may not need to geospatially align case data with sewershed boundaries to gain insights into disease transmission. Although wastewater trend lines captured clear differences in the Delta versus Omicron surge trajectories, no single wastewater metric (detectability, percent change, or flow-population normalized viral concentrations) reliably signaled when these surges started. After iteratively examining different combinations of these three metrics, we developed the Covid-SURGE (Signaling Unprecedented Rises in Groupwide Exposure) algorithm, which identifies unprecedented signals in the wastewater data. With a true positive rate of 82%, a false positive rate of 7%, and strong performance during both surges and in small and large sites, our algorithm provides public health officials with an automated way to flag community-level COVID-19 surges in real time.","Algorithms|Benchmarking|COVID-19|COVID-19 surge|Disease Outbreaks|Humans|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|alert algorithm|early warning|wastewater monitoring","Keshaviah, Aparna|Huff, Ian|Hu, Xindi C|Guidry, Virginia|Christensen, Ariel|Berkowitz, Steven|Reckling, Stacie|Noble, Rachel T|Clerkin, Thomas|Blackwood, Denene|McLellan, Sandra L|Roguet, Adélaïde|Musse, Isabel",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,DA053899,1U01DA053899-01,phs002729.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,4.5,"The publication abstract describes the development of an algorithm to identify COVID-19 surges using wastewater data, which aligns with the funding opportunity's objective of improving wastewater-based testing for public health management.

Importantly, the electrochemical biosensor directly detects the virus itself, as opposed to a surrogate or signature of the virus, and is sensitive to as little as 10 viral particles in a sample.

However, detection and concentration of pathogens in the environmental samples and their efficacy in predicting infectious diseases can be influenced by meteorological conditions and quality of samples. This research examines whether meteorological conditions and sample pH affect SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater samples, and whether the association of SARS-CoV-2 with COVID-19 cases and mortality improves when adjusted for meteorological conditions and sample pH value in Miami-Dade County, FL. Daily wastewater samples were collected from Miami-Dade Wastewater Treatment Plant in Key Biscayne, Florida from August 2021 to August 2022. The samples were analyzed for pH and spiked with OC43. RNA was extracted from the concentrated wastewater sample and SARS-CoV-2 was quantified using qPCR. COVID-19 and mortality data were acquired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and meteorological data from the National Climatic Data Center. COVID-19 case and mortality rates were modelled with respect to time-lagged wastewater SARS-CoV-2 adjusting for meteorological conditions, and sample pH value and OC43 recovery. Temperature, dew point, pH values and OC43 recovery showed significant associations with wastewater SARS-CoV-2. Time-lagged wastewater SARS-CoV-2 showed significant associations with COVID-19 case and mortality incidence rates. This association improved when wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels were adjusted for (or instrumented on) meteorological conditions, OC43 recovery, and sample pH. A 0.47% change in COVID-19 case incidence rate was associated with 1% change in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 (β ~ 0.47; 95% CI = 0.29 - 0.64; p < 0.001). A 0.12 % change in COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with 1 % change in SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater 44 days prior. A 0.07% decline in COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with a unit increase in ambient temperature 28 days prior. Time lagged wastewater SARS-CoV-2 (and its adjustment for sample pH and RNA recovery) and meteorological conditions can be used for the surveillance of COVID-19 case and mortality.

Wastewater analysis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA requires specialized equipment, expensive consumables, and expert staff, limiting its feasibility and scalability. Further, the extremely labile nature of viral RNA complicates sample transportation, especially in regions with limited access to reliable cold chains. Here, we present a new method for wastewater analysis, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), that substantially simplifies workflow (at least 70% decrease in time; 40% decrease in consumable usage compared with traditional techniques) by targeting the labor-intensive processing steps of RNA purification and concentration. To optimize and validate this method, we analyzed wastewater samples from residence halls at the University of Kentucky, of which 34% (44/129) contained detectible SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Although concurrent clinical testing was not comprehensive, student infections were identified in the 7 days following a positive wastewater detection in 68% of samples.

Pathogen surveillance systems faced pressure to quickly establish response protocols, offering an opportunity to employ wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for population-level monitoring. The pilot study reported herein aimed to: (i) develop a reliable protocol for MPXV DNA detection in wastewater which would reduce false negative reporting, (ii) test this protocol on wastewater from various regions across the United States, and (iii) conduct a state of the science review of the current literature reporting on experimental methods for MPXV detection using WBE. Twenty-four-hour composite samples of untreated municipal wastewater were collected from the states of New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, and Washington beginning July 3rd, 2022 through October 16th, 2022 (n = 60). Samples underwent vacuum filtration, DNA extraction from captured solids, MPXV DNA pre-amplification, and qPCR analysis.

The presence of clade IIb MPXV DNA in these samples was confirmed via Sanger sequencing and integration of pre-amplification prior to qPCR decreased the rate of false negative detections by 87% as compared to qPCR analysis alone. Wastewater-derived detections of MPXV were compared to clinical datasets, with 50% of detections occurring as clinical cases were increasing/peaking and 50% occurring as clinical cases waned.

Although studies have found that central venous catheter (CVC) is often associated with poor outcomes and switching to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) is beneficial, it has not been fully elucidated how the effect of switching of access on outcomes changes over time and whether the effect depends on switching time. In this paper we propose to relate the observed survival time for patients without access change and the counterfactual time for patients with access change using an AFT model with time-varying effects. The flexibility of AFT model allows us to account for baseline effect and the prognostic effect from covariates at access change while estimating the effect of access change. The effect of access change overtime is modeled nonparametrically using a cubic spline function. Simulation studies show excellent performance.

Devices integrated with electrochemical biosensors may be an interesting alternative to respond to the high demand for testing, particularly in contexts where access to standard detection technologies is lacking. Aptamers as recognition elements are useful due to their stability, specificity, and sensitivity to binding target molecules. We have developed a non-invasive electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor targeting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva. The aptamer is expected to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and its variants. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes coated with platinum nanoparticles were biofunctionalized with a biotin-tagged aptamer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for BA.1 sensing was conducted in sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate solution supplemented with pooled saliva. To estimate sensing performance, the aptasensor was tested with contrived samples of UV-attenuated virions from 10 to 10,000 copies/ml. Selectivity was assessed by exposing the aptasensor to non-targeted viruses (hCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). EIS data outputs were further used to select a suitable response variable and cutoff frequency. Capacitance increases in response to the gradual loading of the attenuated BA.1. The aptasensor was sensitive and specific for BA.1 at a lower viral load (10-100 copies/ml) and was capable of discriminating between negative and positive contrived samples (with strain specificity against other viruses: OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). The aptasensor detected SARS-CoV-2 with an estimated LOD of 1790 copies/ml in contrived samples. In human clinical samples, the aptasensor presents an accuracy of 72%, with 75% of positive percent of agreement and 67% of negative percent of agreement. Our results show that the aptasensor is a promising candidate to detect SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection when virion concentrations are low, which may be useful for preventing the asymptomatic spread of CoVID-19.","COVID-19|Graphite|Humans|Influenza, Human|Lasers|Metal Nanoparticles|Oligonucleotides|Pandemics|Platinum|SARS-CoV-2|Saliva","Moreira, Geisianny|Qian, Hanyu|Datta, Shoumen Palit Austin|Bliznyuk, Nikolay|Carpenter, Jeremiah|Dean, Delphine|McLamore, Eric|Vanegas, Diana",PloS one,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,AA029328,1U01AA029328-01,phs002546.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,5.0,"The publication directly addresses the specific research aims and methodology outlined in the funding opportunity and grant's abstract.

Loss of taste is possible but rare with these illnesses, and patient reports of 'taste loss' typically arise from a taste / flavor confusion. Thus, initial reports from COVID-19 patients of loss of taste and chemesthesis (i.e., chemical somatosensation like warming or cooling) were met with skepticism until multiple studies confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections could disrupt these senses. Many studies have been based on self-report or on single time point assessments after acute illness was ended. Here, we describe intensive longitudinal data over 28 days from adults aged 18-45 years recruited in early 2021 (i.e., prior to the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 waves). These individuals were either COVID-19 positive or close contacts (per U.S. CDC criteria at the time of the study) in the first half of 2021. Upon enrollment, all participants were given nose clips, blinded samples of commercial jellybeans (Sour Cherry and Cinnamon), and scratch-n-sniff odor identification test cards (ScentCheckPro), which they used for daily assessments. In COVID-19 cases who enrolled on or before Day 10 of infection, Gaussian Process Regression showed two distinct measures of function - odor identification and odor intensity - declined relative to controls (exposed individuals who never developed COVID-19). Because enrollment began upon exposure, some participants became ill only after enrollment, which allowed us to capture baseline ratings, onset of loss, and recovery. Data from these four cases and four age- and sex- matched controls were plotted over 28 days to create panel plots. Variables included mean orthonasal intensity of four odors (ScentCheckPro), perceived nasal blockage, oral burn (Cinnamon jellybeans), and sourness and sweetness (Sour Cherry jellybeans). Controls exhibited stable ratings over time. By contrast, COVID-19 cases showed sharp deviations over time. Changes in odor intensity or odor identification were not explained by nasal blockage. No single pattern of taste loss or recovery was apparent, implying different taste qualities might recover at different rates. Oral burn was transiently reduced for some before recovering quickly, suggesting acute loss may be missed in datasets collected only after illness ends. Collectively, intensive daily testing shows orthonasal smell, oral chemesthesis and taste were each altered by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to use a data-driven approach to identify clinical subgroups. We analysed clinical data from patients with Kawasaki disease diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego, CA, USA) between Jan 1, 2002, and June 30, 2022. Patients were grouped by hierarchical clustering on principal components with k-means parcellation based on 14 variables, including age at onset, ten laboratory test results, day of illness at the first intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, and normalised echocardiographic measures of coronary artery diameters at diagnosis. We also analysed the seasonality and Kawasaki disease incidence from 2002 to 2019 by subgroup. To explore the biological underpinnings of identified subgroups, we did differential abundance analysis on proteomic data of 6481 proteins from 32 patients with Kawasaki disease and 24 healthy children, using linear regression models that controlled for age and sex. Among 1016 patients with complete data in the final analysis, four subgroups were identified with distinct clinical features: (1) hepatobiliary involvement with elevated alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and total bilirubin levels, lowest coronary artery aneurysm but highest intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates (n=157); (2) highest band neutrophil count and Kawasaki disease shock rate (n=231); (3) cervical lymphadenopathy with high markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, and platelet counts) and lowest age-adjusted haemoglobin Z scores (n=315); and (4) young age at onset with highest coronary artery aneurysm but lowest intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates (n=313). The subgroups had distinct seasonal and incidence trajectories. In addition, the subgroups shared 211 differential abundance proteins while many proteins were unique to a subgroup. Our data-driven analysis provides insight into the heterogeneity of Kawasaki disease, and supports the existence of distinct subgroups with important implications for clinical management and research design and interpretation.

Non-potable water reuse represents the largest potential reuse market. Yet economic constraints for new water reuse infrastructure and safety concerns due to microbial water quality, and especially viral pathogen exposure, limit widespread implementation of water reuse. Cost-effective, real-time methods to measure or indicate viral quality of recycled water would do much to instill greater confidence in the practice. This manuscript discusses advancements in monitoring and modeling of viral health risks in the context of water reuse. First, we describe the current wastewater reclamation processes and treatment technologies with an emphasis on virus removal. Second, we review technologies for the measurement of viruses, both culture- and molecular-based, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We introduce promising viral surrogates and specific pathogenic viruses that can serve as indicators of viral risk for water reuse. We suggest metagenomic analyses for viral screening and flow cytometry for quantification of virus-like particles as new approaches to complement more traditional methods. Third, we describe modeling to assess health risks through quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs), the most common strategy to couple data on virus concentrations with human exposure scenarios. We then explore the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to incorporate suites of data from wastewater treatment processes, water quality parameters, and viral surrogates. We recommend ANNs as a means to utilize existing water quality data, alongside new complementary measures of viral quality, to achieve cost-effective strategies to assess risks associated with infectious human viruses in recycled water. Given the review, we conclude that technologies are ready for identifying and implementing viral surrogates for health risk reduction in the next decade.

An objective method with high specificity and high sensitivity to identify current or imminent MIS-C in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable. The aim was to learn about an interpretable novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel providing such an objective classification. This retrospective study was conducted on four groups of pediatric patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX who consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 70 MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January and May 2021 infected predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 MIS-C patients seen between August and October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between October 2021 andJanuary 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 was used to train an L1-regularized logistic regression model which was tested using five-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the remaining naïve groups.

Previously, we clinically validated a saliva-based RT-qPCR diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 to provide low-cost testing with high throughput and low turnaround time on a university campus. Here, we developed a respiratory diagnostic panel to detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B within a single saliva sample. When compared to clinical results, our assay demonstrated 93.5% accuracy for influenza A samples (43/46 concordant results) with no effect on SARS-CoV-2 accuracy or limit of detection. In addition, our assay can detect simulated coinfections at varying virus concentrations generated from synthetic RNA controls. We also confirmed the stability of influenza A in saliva at room temperature for up to 5 days. The cost of the assay is lower than standard nasopharyngeal swab respiratory panel tests as saliva collection does not require specialized swabs or trained clinical personnel. By repurposing the lab infrastructure developed for the COVID-19 pandemic, our multiplex assay can be used to provide expanded access to respiratory disease diagnostics, especially for community, school, or university testing applications where saliva testing was effectively utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.","COVID-19|Communicable Diseases|Humans|Influenza, Human|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Universities|flu|influenza|saliva|surveillance testing|virus","King, Kylie L|Ham, Rachel|Smothers, Austin|Lee, Isaac|Bowie, Tyler|Teetsel, Erika|Peng, Congyue|Dean, Delphine",Frontiers in public health,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2023,AA029328,1U01AA029328-01,phs002546.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,4.0,"The publication abstract describes the development of a multiplex RT-qPCR diagnostic panel for detecting SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B in saliva.

As the public health emergency has ended, researchers and practitioners are looking to shift the focus of existing wastewater surveillance programs to other targets, including bacteria. Bacterial targets may pose some unique challenges for WBE applications. To explore the current state of the field, the National Science Foundation-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) on Wastewater Based Epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Public Health Threats held a workshop in April 2023 to discuss the challenges and needs for wastewater bacterial surveillance. The targets and methods used in existing programs were diverse, with twelve different targets and nine different methods listed. Discussions during the workshop highlighted the challenges in adapting existing programs and identified research gaps in four key areas: choosing new targets, relating bacterial wastewater data to human disease incidence and prevalence, developing methods, and normalizing results. To help with these challenges and research gaps, the authors identified steps the larger community can take to improve bacteria wastewater surveillance. This includes developing data reporting standards and method optimization and validation for bacterial programs.

Its unparalleled sensitivity and compatibility with intricate biological samples make it an ideal candidate for revolutionizing noninvasive diagnostic methods. However, a significant challenge that mars its efficacy is the throughput limitation, primarily anchored in the prerequisite of hotspot and sEV colocalization within a minuscule range. This paper delves deep into this issue, introducing a never-attempted-before approach which harnesses the principles of crystallization-nucleation and growth. By synergistically coupling lasers with plasmonic resonances, we navigate the challenges associated with the analyte droplet drying method and the notorious coffee ring effect. Our method, rooted in a profound understanding of crystallization's materials science, exhibits the potential to significantly increase the areal density of accessible plasmonic hotspots and efficiently guide exosomes to defined regions.

The study population included 118 KD patients who met American Heart Association KD criteria and compared them to 946 MIS-C patients who met 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. All included patients had at least one measurement of amino-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) or cardiac troponin I (TnI), and echocardiography. Regression analyses were used to determine associations between cardiac biomarker levels, diagnosis, and cardiac involvement. Higher NTproBNP (≥ 1500 ng/L) and TnI (≥ 20 ng/L) at presentation were associated with MIS-C versus KD with specificity of 77 and 89%, respectively. Higher biomarker levels were associated with shock and intensive care unit admission; higher NTproBNP was associated with longer hospital length of stay. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more pronounced for MIS-C, was also associated with higher biomarker levels. Coronary artery involvement was not associated with either biomarker.

This strategy was based upon wastewater RNA measurements of the viral target, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The utility of WBS for assessing the spread of COVID-19 has motivated research to measure targets beyond SARS-CoV-2, including pathogens containing DNA. The objective of this study was to establish the necessary steps for isolating DNA from wastewater by modifying a long-standing RNA-specific extraction workflow optimized for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Modifications were made to the sample concentration process and included an evaluation of bead bashing prior to the extraction of either DNA or RNA. Results showed that bead bashing reduced detection of RNA from wastewater but improved recovery of DNA as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bead bashing is therefore not recommended for the quantification of RNA viruses using qPCR. Whereas for Mycobacterium bacterial DNA isolation, bead bashing was necessary for improving qPCR quantification. Overall, we recommend 2 separate workflows, one for RNA viruses that does not include bead bashing and one for other microbes that use bead bashing for DNA isolation. The experimentation done here shows that current-standing WBS program methodologies optimized for SARS-CoV-2 need to be modified and reoptimized to allow for alternative pathogens to be readily detected and monitored, expanding its utility as a tool for public health assessment.","COVID-19|Humans|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring|Workflow","Babler, Kristina M|Sharkey, Mark E|Amirali, Ayaaz|Boone, Melinda M|Comerford, Samuel|Currall, Benjamin B|Grills, George S|Laine, Jennifer|Mason, Christopher E|Reding, Brian|Schürer, Stephan|Stevenson, Mario|Vidović, Dušica|Williams, Sion L|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,Journal Article,2023,DA053941,1U01DA053941-01,phs002525.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,4.5,"The publication abstract describes a study that modifies an existing RNA extraction workflow to isolate DNA from wastewater, which is relevant to the funding opportunity's focus on optimizing wastewater-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.

To accomplish this, the inner surface is modified to present binding moieties for the desired analyte. While this approach has been successful in research settings, it is challenging to scale many surface modification strategies. Traditional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices can be effectively functionalized using silane-based methods; however, it requires high labor hours, cleanroom equipment, and hazardous chemicals. Manufacture of microfluidic devices using plastics, including cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), allows chips to be mass produced, but most functionalization methods used with PDMS are not compatible with plastic. Here we demonstrate how to deposit biotin onto the surface of a plastic microfluidic chips using aryl-diazonium. This method chemically bonds biotin to the surface, allowing for the addition of streptavidin nanoparticles to the surface. Nanoparticles increase the surface area of the chip and allow for proper capture moiety orientation. Our process is faster, can be performed outside of a fume hood, is very cost-effective using readily available laboratory equipment, and demonstrates higher rates of capture. Additionally, our method allows for more rapid and scalable production of devices, including for diagnostic testing.",cyclic olefin copolymer (COC)|extracellular vesicles|immunoaffinity capture|microfluidics|surface-chemistry,"Rabe, Daniel C|Ho, Uyen|Choudhury, Adarsh|Wallace, Jessica|Luciani, Evelyn|Lee, Dasol|Flynn, Elizabeth|Stott, Shannon L",Advanced materials technologies,Journal Article,2023,TR003793,1U18TR003793-01,phs002778.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,4.0,"The publication abstract describes a method for functionalizing plastic microfluidic devices using aryl-diazonium salts, which improves immunoaffinity capture.

College students had to contend with clinical testing while simultaneously dealing with health risks and the academic pressures brought on by quarantines, changes to virtual platforms, and other disruptions to daily life. The objective of this study was to analyze whether wastewater surveillance can be used to decrease the intensity of clinical testing while maintaining reliable measurements of diseases incidence on campus. Twelve months of human health and wastewater surveillance data for eight residential buildings on a university campus were analyzed to establish how SARS-CoV-2 levels in the wastewater can be used to minimize clinical testing burden on students. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels were used to create multiple scenarios, each with differing levels of testing intensity, which were compared to the actual testing volumes implemented by the university. We found that scenarios in which testing intensity fluctuations matched rise and falls in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels had stronger correlations between SARS-CoV-2 levels and recorded clinical positives. In addition to stronger correlations, most scenarios resulted in overall fewer weekly clinical tests performed. We suggest the use of wastewater surveillance to guide COVID-19 testing as it can significantly increase the efficacy of COVID-19 surveillance while reducing the burden placed on college students during a pandemic.

We sought to determine the origin of one such cryptic wastewater lineage by tracking and characterising its persistence and genomic evolution over time. We first detected a cryptic lineage, WI-CL-001, in municipal wastewater in Wisconsin, USA, in January, 2022. To determine the source of WI-CL-001, we systematically sampled wastewater from targeted sub-sewershed lines and maintenance holes using compositing autosamplers. Viral concentrations in wastewater samples over time were measured by RT digital PCR. In addition to using metagenomic 12s rRNA sequencing to determine the virus's host species, we also sequenced SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domains, and, where possible, whole viral genomes to identify and characterise the evolution of this lineage. We traced WI-CL-001 to its source at a single commercial building. There we detected the cryptic lineage at concentrations as high as 2·7 × 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies per L. The majority of 12s rRNA sequences detected in wastewater leaving the identified source building were human. Additionally, we generated over 100 viral receptor binding domain and whole-genome sequences from wastewater samples containing the cryptic lineage collected over the 13 consecutive months this virus was detectable (January, 2022, to January, 2023). These sequences contained a combination of fixed nucleotide substitutions characteristic of Pango lineage B.1.234, which circulated in humans in Wisconsin at low levels from October, 2020, to February, 2021. Despite this, mutations in the spike gene and elsewhere resembled those subsequently found in omicron variants. We propose that prolonged detection of WI-CL-001 in wastewater indicates persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from a single human initially infected by an ancestral B.1.234 virus. The accumulation of convergent omicron-like mutations in WI-CL-001's ancestral B.1.234 genome probably reflects persistent infection and extensive within-host evolution. People who shed cryptic lineages could be an important source of highly divergent viruses that sporadically emerge and spread.

Diagnosis of COVID-19 infection via RT-PCR was crucial in reducing spread of disease and informing treatment management. While RT-PCR is a key diagnostic test, there is room for improvement in the development of diagnostic criteria. Identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath provides a fast, reliable, and economically favorable alternative for disease detection. This meta-analysis analyzed the diagnostic performance of VOC-based breath analysis in detection of COVID-19 infection. A systematic review of twenty-nine papers using the grading criteria from Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and PRISMA guidelines was conducted. The cumulative results showed a sensitivity of 0.92 (95 % CI, 90 %-95 %) and a specificity of 0.90 (95 % CI 87 %-93 %). Subgroup analysis by variant demonstrated strong sensitivity to the original strain compared to the Omicron and Delta variant in detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We consider a situation when we have time series data from multiple units that share similar patterns when aligned in terms of an internal time. The internal time is defined as an index according to evolving features of interest. When mapped back to the calendar time, these time series can span different time intervals that can include the future calendar time of the targeted unit, over which we can borrow the information from other units in forecasting the targeted unit. We first build a hierarchical state space model for the multiple time series data in terms of the internal time, where the shared components capture the similarities among different units while allowing for unit-specific deviations. A conditional state space model is then constructed to incorporate the information of existing units as the prior information in forecasting the targeted unit. By running the Kalman filtering based on the conditional state space model on the targeted unit, we incorporate both the information from the other units and the history of the targeted unit. The forecasts are then transformed from internal time back into calendar time for ease of interpretation. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance.

Among additive manufacturing methods, screen printing is particularly desirable for high-throughput production of sensing platforms. However, this technique needs to be combined with carefully formulated inks, rapid postprocessing, and selective functionalization to meet all requirements for high-performance biosensing applications. Here, we present screen-printed graphene electrodes that are processed with thermal annealing to achieve high surface area and electrical conductivity for sensitive biodetection via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As a proof-of-concept, this biosensing platform is utilized for electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2. To ensure reliable specificity in the presence of multiple variants, biolayer interferometry (BLI) is used as a label-free and dynamic screening method to identify optimal antibodies for concurrent affinity to the Spike S1 proteins of Delta, Omicron, and Wild Type SARS-CoV-2 variants while maintaining low affinity to competing pathogens such as Influenza H1N1. The BLI-identified antibodies are robustly bound to the graphene electrode surface via oxygen moieties that are introduced during the thermal annealing process. The resulting electrochemical immunosensors achieve superior metrics including rapid detection (55 s readout following 15 min of incubation), low limits of detection (approaching 500 ag/mL for the Omicron variant), and high selectivity toward multiple variants. Importantly, the sensors perform well on clinical saliva samples detecting as few as 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, following CDC protocols. The combination of the screen-printed graphene sensing platform and effective antibody selection using BLI can be generalized to a wide range of point-of-care immunosensors.","Biosensing Techniques|COVID-19|Electrochemical Techniques|Electrodes|Graphite|Humans|Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype|Interferometry|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|additive manufacturing|biosensing|electrochemical impedance spectroscopy|immunosensor|printed electronics","Szydlowska, Beata M|Pola, Cícero C|Cai, Zizhen|Chaney, Lindsay E|Hui, Janan|Sheets, Robert|Carpenter, Jeremiah|Dean, Delphine|Claussen, Jonathan C|Gomes, Carmen L|Hersam, Mark C",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Journal Article,2024,AA029328,1U01AA029328-01,phs002546.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,4.5,"The publication abstract describes the development of a screen-printed graphene biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

They have garnered increasing attention because of their potential for both the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The diversity of sEVs derives from their biological composition and cargo content. Currently, the isolation of sEV subpopulations is primarily based on bio-physical and affinity-based approaches. Since a standardized definition for sEV subpopulations is yet to be fully established, it is important to further investigate the correlation between the biomolecular composition of sEVs and their physical properties. In this study, we employed a platform combining single-vesicle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning to examine individual sEVs isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The biomolecular composition of each vesicle examined was reflected by its corresponding SERS spectral features (biomolecular ""fingerprints""), with their roots in the composition of their collective Raman-active bonds. Origins of the SERS spectral features were validated through a comparative analysis between SERS and mass spectrometry (MS). SERS fingerprinting of individual vesicles was effective in overcoming the challenges posed by EV population averaging, allowing for the possibility of analyzing the variations in biomolecular composition between the vesicles of similar and/or different sizes. Using this approach, we uncovered that each of the size-based fractions of sEVs contained particles with predominantly similar SERS spectral features. Indeed, more than 84% of the vesicles residing within a particular group were clearly distinguishable from that of the other EV sub-populations, despite some spectral variations within each sub-population. Our results suggest the possibility that size-based EV fractionation methods produce samples where similarly eluted sEVs are correlated with their respective biochemical contents, as reflected by their SERS spectra. Our findings therefore highlight the possibility that the biogenesis and respective biological functionalities of the various sEV fractions may be inherently different.","Chromatography, Gel|Extracellular Vesicles|Humans|Machine Learning|Mass Spectrometry|Spectrum Analysis, Raman","Liu, Zirui|Ng, Martin|Srivastava, Siddharth|Li, Tieyi|Liu, Jun|Phu, Tuan Anh|Mateescu, Bogdan|Wang, Yi-Ting|Tsai, Chia-Feng|Liu, Tao|Raffai, Robert L|Xie, Ya-Hong",PloS one,Journal Article,2024,TR003778,1U18TR003778-01,phs002544.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,4.5,"The publication abstract describes a method using single-vesicle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the biomolecular composition of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs).

Our objective was to identify selected immune molecules that could explain, in part, why certain SARS-CoV-2-infected children developed MIS-C. We hypothesized that type-2 helper T cell-mediated inflammation can elicit autoantibodies, which may account for some of the differences observed between the moderate-severe COVID-19 (COVID<sup>+</sup>) and MIS-C cohort.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers against the ancestral strain (WA1) and Omicron sublineages were evaluated in unvaccinated children admitted for COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 32) and MIS-C (<i>n</i> = 32) at the time of hospitalization (baseline) and at six to eight weeks post-discharge (follow-up) between 1 April 2020, and 1 September 2022. In addition, antibody binding to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) from WA1, BA.1, BA.2.75, and BA.4/BA.5 was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). At baseline, the children with MIS-C demonstrated two-fold to three-fold higher binding and neutralizing antibodies against ancestral WA1 compared to those with COVID-19. Importantly, in children with COVID-19, the virus neutralization titers against the Omicron subvariants at six to eight weeks post-discharge reached the same level as those with MIS-C had at baseline but were higher than titers at 6-8 weeks post-discharge for MIS-C cases.

The fabrication technique is simple, yet the batch-to-batch variation of LIG quality is not well documented in the literature. In this study, we conduct experiments to characterize batch-to-batch variation in the manufacturing of LIG electrodes for applications in electrochemical sensing. Numerous batches of 36 LIG electrodes were synthesized using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser system on polyimide film. The LIG material was characterized using goniometry, stereomicroscopy, open circuit potentiometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Hydrophobicity and electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry) indicate that LIG electrode batch-to-batch variation is less than 5% when using a commercial reference and counter electrode. Metallization of LIG led to a significant increase in peak current and specific capacitance (area between anodic/cathodic curve). However, batch-to-batch variation increased to approximately 30%. Two different platinum electrodeposition techniques were studied, including galvanostatic and frequency-modulated electrodeposition. The study shows that formation of metallized LIG electrodes with high specific capacitance and peak current may come at the expense of high batch variability. This design tradeoff has not been discussed in the literature and is an important consideration if scaling sensor designs for mass use is desired. This study provides important insight into the variation of LIG material properties for scalable development of LIG sensors.

Here, we present Rolosense, a virus sensing platform that leverages the motion of 5 μm DNA-based motors on RNA fuel chips to transduce the presence of viruses. Motors and chips are modified with aptamers, which are designed for multivalent binding to viral targets and lead to stalling of motion. Therefore, the motors perform a ""mechanical test"" of the viral target and stall in the presence of whole virions, which represents a unique mechanism of transduction distinct from conventional assays. Rolosense can detect SARS-CoV-2 spiked in artificial saliva and exhaled breath condensate with a sensitivity of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL and discriminates among other respiratory viruses. The assay is modular and amenable to multiplexing, as demonstrated by our one-pot detection of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. As a proof of concept, we show that readout can be achieved using a smartphone camera with a microscopic attachment in as little as 15 min without amplification reactions.

However, existing methods of viral isolation are time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the multiple processing steps required, resulting in low yields. Here, we introduce the rapid, efficient, and high-resolution acoustofluidic isolation of viruses from complex biological samples via Bessel beam excitation separation technology (BEST). BEST isolates viruses by utilizing the nondiffractive and self-healing properties of 2D, in-plane acoustic Bessel beams to continuously separate cell-free viruses from biofluids, with high throughput and high viral RNA yield. By tuning the acoustic parameters, the cutoff size of isolated viruses can be easily adjusted to perform dynamic, size-selective virus isolation while simultaneously trapping larger particles and separating smaller particles and contaminants from the sample, achieving high-precision isolation of the target virus. BEST was used to isolate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from human saliva samples and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus from cell culture media, demonstrating its potential use in both practical diagnostic applications and fundamental virology research. With high separation resolution, high yield, and high purity, BEST is a powerful tool for rapidly and efficiently isolating viruses.

One commonly estimated metric is the rate of change in pathogen quantity, which typically correlates with clinical surveillance in retrospective analyses. However, the accuracy of rate of change estimation approaches has not previously been evaluated. We assessed the performance of approaches for estimating rates of change in wastewater pathogen loads by generating synthetic wastewater time series data for which rates of change were known. Each approach was also evaluated on real-world data. Smooth trends and their first derivatives were jointly sampled from Gaussian processes (GP) and independent errors were added to generate synthetic viral load measurements; the range hyperparameter and error variance were varied to produce nine simulation scenarios representing different potential disease patterns. The directions and magnitudes of the rate of change estimates from four estimation approaches (two established and two developed in this work) were compared to the GP first derivative to evaluate classification and quantitative accuracy. Each approach was also implemented for public SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring data collected January 2021-May 2023 at 25 sites in North Carolina, USA. All four approaches inconsistently identified the correct direction of the trend given by the sign of the GP first derivative. Across all nine simulated disease patterns, between a quarter and a half of all estimates indicated the wrong trend direction, regardless of estimation approach. The proportion of trends classified as plateaus (statistically indistinguishable from zero) for the North Carolina SARS-CoV-2 data varied considerably by estimation method but not by site.

However, the wet lab constraints (economic, infrastructural, and personnel) of translating novel virus variant sequence information to meaningful immunological and structural insights that are valuable for the development of broadly acting countermeasures (especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses) remain a challenge in many resource-limited settings. Here, we describe a workflow that couples wastewater surveillance, high-throughput sequencing, phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and virus capsid structure modeling for the genotype-to-serotype characterization of uncultivated picornavirus sequences identified in wastewater. Specifically, we analyzed canine picornaviruses (CanPVs), which are uncultivated and yet-to-be-assigned members of the family <i>Picornaviridae</i> that cause systemic infections in canines. We analyzed 118 archived (stored at -20 °C) wastewater (WW) samples representing a population of ~700,000 persons in southwest USA between October 2019 to March 2020 and October 2020 to March 2021. Samples were pooled into 12 two-liter volumes by month, partitioned (into filter-trapped solids [FTSs] and filtrates) using 450 nm membrane filters, and subsequently concentrated to 2 mL (1000×) using 10,000 Da MW cutoff centrifugal filters. The 24 concentrates were subjected to RNA extraction, CanPV complete capsid single-contig RT-PCR, Illumina sequencing, phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and structure prediction. We detected CanPVs in 58.3% (14/24) of the samples generated 13,824,046 trimmed Illumina reads and 27 CanPV contigs. Phylogenetic and pairwise identity analyses showed eight CanPV genotypes (intragenotype divergence <14%) belonging to four clusters, with intracluster divergence of <20%. Similarity analysis, immuno-informatics, and virus protomer and capsid structure prediction suggested that the four clusters were likely distinct serological types, with predicted cluster-distinguishing B-cell epitopes clustered in the northern and southern rims of the canyon surrounding the 5-fold axis of symmetry. Our approach allows forgenotype-to-serotype characterization of uncultivated picornavirus sequences by coupling phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and virus capsid structure prediction.

In this study, we explored the utility of circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma as an analyte for the differential diagnosis and characterization of pediatric inflammatory syndromes. We profiled cfRNA in 370 plasma samples from pediatric patients with a range of inflammatory conditions, including Kawasaki disease (KD), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), viral infections, and bacterial infections. We developed machine learning models based on these cfRNA profiles, which effectively differentiated KD from MIS-C-two conditions presenting with overlapping symptoms-with high performance [test area under the curve = 0.98].

We used targeted amplicon sequencing to track diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants across space and time, and we found a tight correspondence with positive PCR tests from University students and Miami-Dade hospital patients. Additionally, in bulk metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate that the bacterial content of different wastewater sampling locations serving small population sizes can be used to detect putative, host-derived microorganisms that themselves have known associations with human health and diet. We also detect multiple enteric pathogens (e.g., Norovirus) and characterize viral diversity across sites. Moreover, we observed an enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in hospital wastewater; antibiotic-specific ARGs correlated to total prescriptions of those same antibiotics (e.g Ampicillin, Gentamicin).

Identifying infected patients early with the support of predictive models helps dialysis centers implement concerted procedures (e.g., temperature screenings, universal masking, isolation treatments) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate outbreaks. We collect data from multiple sources, including demographics, clinical, treatment, laboratory, vaccination, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 surveillance. Previous early prediction models, such as logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost, require sophisticated feature engineering and need improved prediction performance. We create deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict SARS-CoV-2 infections during incubation. Our study shows deep learning models with minimal feature engineering can identify those infected patients more accurately than previously built models. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consistently performed well, with an AUC exceeding 0.80, peaking at 0.91 in August 2021. The CNN model also demonstrated strong results with an AUC above 0.75. Both models outperformed previous best XGBoost models by over 0.10 in AUC. Prediction accuracy declined as the pandemic evolved, dropping to approximately 0.75 between September 2021 and January 2022. Maintaining a 20% false positive rate, our LSTM and CNN models identified 66% and 64% of positive cases among patients, significantly outperforming XGBoost models at 42%. We also identify key features for dialysis patients by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the input features. By closely monitoring these factors, dialysis patients can receive earlier diagnoses and care, leading to less severe outcomes. Our research highlights the effectiveness of deep neural networks in analyzing longitudinal data, especially in predicting COVID-19 infections during the crucial incubation period.

Here, we present the design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called DNA NanoGripper, that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by naturally evolved human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages. Each NanoGripper finger consists of three phalanges connected by three rotatable joints that are bendable in response to the binding of other entities. NanoGripper functions are enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We demonstrate that the NanoGripper can be engineered to effectively interact with and capture nanometer-scale objects, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. With multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate a fluorescent signal that is enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a highly sensitive biosensor that selectively detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ~100 copies per milliliter, providing a sensitivity equal to that of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Quantified by flow cytometry assays, we demonstrated that the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, suggesting its potential for inhibiting virus infections.

Here, we introduce an alternative digital molecular diagnostics, termed dCRISTOR, by seamlessly integrating deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-engineered micromotors, extraction-free loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), low-cost bright field microscopy, and deep learning-enabled image processing. The micromotor, composed of a polystyrene sphere attached to a magnetic bead, incorporates a dCas9 ribonucleoprotein complex. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) RNA in a sample results in the formation of large-sized amplicons that can be specifically captured by the micromotors, reducing their velocity induced by an external magnetic field. The micromotor is propelled by an external magnetic field, which eliminates the need for chemical fuels, reducing system complexity, and allowing for precise control over micromotor movement, enhancing accuracy and reliability. A convolutional neural network classification-based multiobject tracking algorithm, CNN-MOT, accurately measures the change in micromotor motion, facilitating the binary digital assay format (""1"" or ""0"") for simplified result interpretation without user bias. Incorporating an extraction-free LAMP assay streamlines the dCRISTOR workflow, enabling qualitative HIV-1 detection in spiked plasma (<i>n</i> = 21) that demonstrates 100% sensitivity and specificity and achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.96 copies/μL.

Processing workflows for WBS typically include sample collection, a primary concentration step, and lysis of the microbes to release nucleic acids, followed by nucleic acid purification and molecular-based quantification. This manuscript provides workflows from beginning to end with an emphasis on filtration-based concentration approaches coupled with specific lysis and nucleic acid extraction processes. Here, two WBS processing approaches are presented, one focusing on RNA-specific pathogens and the other focused on DNA-specific pathogens found within wastewater: 1) The RNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing RNA viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) couples electronegative filtration of wastewater with the placement of the filter within a lysis buffer followed by direct RNA extraction. 2) The DNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing DNA pathogens like <i>Candida auris</i>, uses size selection membranes during filtration, subsequently followed by a lysis buffer, bead-beating, and DNA extraction. Separate workflows for RNA versus DNA isolations have the advantage of improving the detection of the target pathogen. A novel aspect of the RNA-specific workflow is the direct extraction of nucleic acids from filter lysates, which shows enhanced recoveries, whereas the DNA-specific approach requires bead beating prior to extraction. Novelty is also provided in a new qPCR approach called Volcano 2nd Generation (V2G), which uses a polymerase capable of using RNA as a template, bypassing the reverse transcriptase step normally required for qPCR.

To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications.

To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications.

The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment. The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (n = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 19). Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.","Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Alzheimer Disease|Alzheimer’s disease|Cognitive Dysfunction|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Mild cognitive impairment|Odorants|Olfaction|Olfaction Disorders|Olfactory Perception|Remote assessment|Screening|Smell","Jobin, Benoît|Magdamo, Colin|Delphus, Daniela|Runde, Andreas|Reineke, Sean|Soto, Alysa Alejandro|Ergun, Beyzanur|Mukhija, Sasha|Albers, Alefiya Dhilla|Albers, Mark W",Scientific reports,Journal Article,2025,DC019579,4U01DC019579-03,phs002964.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,3.5,"The publication abstract describes a remote olfactory assessment tool, the AROMHA Brain Health Test, designed to screen for cognitive impairment, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease.

Accurate predictive classification methods are required to correctly identify and treat patients. Here, the onset of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a more serious form of COVID-19, was predicted in a pediatric population using a set of multivariate immunological biomarker expression values. A first-stage bivariate detection of statistically significant biomarkers was obtained from a chosen set of standard cytokines and chemokine biomarkers considered relevant to COVID-19-related infection and disease. To incorporate the observed correlation structure among the resulting set of significant biomarkers, dimension reduction was then applied in the form of principal components. A second-stage logistic regression model using a small number of the principal component variables provided a highly predictive classification model for MIS-C.

One approach for documenting disease spread includes wastewater (WW) surveillance of the virus that causes COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) and other infectious pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether wastewater can be used to track children's health at grade schools in an underserved community, which was vulnerable due to limited health-based data and difficulties in implementing mitigation measures. The 18-month study was initiated during January 2022 at 9 grade schools (3 high, 2 middle, and 4 elementary schools) characterized as low income. Children's health was evaluated through absenteeism due to difficulties in attaining representative clinical diagnoses through school-based clinics. Wastewater measurements of SARS-CoV-2 were available weekly through grab sample collection and RNA extraction followed by quantification using qPCR. The average absenteeism rate was 7.1%, ranging from 4.6% to 12.5% per school. Fraction of WW samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 38% with SARS-Cov-2 levels ranging from detection limits (100 gc/L) to a maximum of 10.2 million gc/L. When data were aggregated across all schools, a statistically significant association was observed between weekly absenteeism rates and WW SARS-CoV-2 with a one percent increase in the log<sub>e</sub> WW SARS-CoV-2 associated with a 1.4% increase in student absence (p < 0.05). When evaluating the data by individual school, this association was strongest at schools with enclosed architecture characterized by limited natural ventilation. For schools with limited resources for clinical diagnosis of illnesses, school absenteeism coupled with wastewater-based monitoring should be utilized for assessing overall health of student populations. Strategies to maintain schools open during pandemics should include consideration of school architecture along with appropriate messaging of WW monitoring results to inform administrators and families.",Absenteeism|COVID-19|Child|Humans|SARS-CoV-2|School Absenteeism|Schools|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Surveillance,"Solo-Gabriele, Helena M|Guevara, Gabriela|Kumar, Naresh|Amirali, Ayaaz|Babler, Kristina M|Beaver, Cynthia C|Comerford, Samuel|Ferraris, Maria|Solle, Natasha Schaefer|Sharkey, Mark E|Gwynn, Lisa",The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,2025,DA053941,1U01DA053941-01,phs002525.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,4.5,"The publication abstract describes a study that uses wastewater surveillance to track children's health in grade schools, specifically looking at absenteeism rates and their association with SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater.

Though rapid diagnostic tests are favored for their speed, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, most tests compromise sensitivity, which risks false-negative results. Here, we present the self-assembly of nanogold triplets on trimeric viral surface proteins for a sensitive colorimetric assay to identify viruses. Gold triplets were self-assembled on the viral trimeric surface proteins using ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. We observed a significant wavelength shift of 70 nm, enabling straightforward naked-eye detection through gold triplets that act as catalysts for producing nanoplasmonic viruses. We established the detection limit of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ml using an effective colorimetric assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

_phs002570.v1.p1,,,doi:10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06434,Understanding Oligonucleotide Hybridization and the Role of Anchoring on the Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Corona Phase for Viral Sensing Applications,"""Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored corona phases (CPs), or surface-adsorbed molecules, have emerged as a promising interface for sensing applications. The adsorption of an analyte can be specifically transduced as a modulation of their band-gap near-infrared (nIR) photoluminescence (PL). One such CP ideal for this purpose is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where subsequent sequence-dependent hybridization can result in PL emission wavelength shifts. Due to ssDNA adsorption to the SWCNT surface, the resultant noncanonical hybridization and its effect on SWCNT photophysical properties are not well understood. In this work, we study 20- and 21-mer DNA and RNA hybridization on the complementary ssDNA-SWCNT CP in the context of nucleic acid sensing for SARS-CoV-2 sequences as model analytes. We found that the van’t Hoff transition enthalpy of hybridization on SWCNT CP was −11.9 kJ mol–1, much lower than that of hybridization in solution (−707 kJ mol–1). We used SWCNT solvatochromism to calculate the solvent-exposed surface area to indicate successful hybridization. We found that having a 30-mer anchor region in addition to the complementary region significantly improved PL response sensitivity and selectivity, with a (GT)15 anchor preferred for RNA targets. Coincubation of ssDNA-SWCNTs with an analyte at 37 °C resulted in faster hybridization kinetics without sacrificing specificity. Other methods aimed to improve CP rearrangement kinetics such as bath sonication and surfactant additions were ineffective. We also determined that the target sequence choice is important as secondary structure formation in the target is negatively correlated with hybridization. Best-performing CPs showed detection limits of 11 and 13 nM for DNA and RNA targets, respectively. Finally, we simulated sensing conditions using the saliva environment, showing sensor compatibility in biofluids. In total, this work elucidates key design features and processing to enable sequence-specific hybridization on ssDNA-SWCNT CPs.""",|Carbon nanotubes|Genetics|Hybridization|Quantum mechanics|Sensors,Cui J|Gong X|Cho S-Y|Jin X|Yang S|Khosravi-Far R|Strano MS,J Phys Chem C,Journal Article,2023,DE030829,1R42DE030829-01,phs002570.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,4.0,"The publication abstract discusses the development of a sensor platform using single-walled carbon nanotubes for nucleic acid sensing, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
