We sought to determine whether similar findings were present in patients with asthma and whether these findings were explained by differences in ventricular size. We measured the PA and aorta diameters in 233 individuals from the Severe Asthma Research Program III cohort. We also estimated right, left, and total epicardial cardiac ventricular volume indices (eERVVI, eELVVI, and eETVVI, respectively). Associations between the cardiac and PA measures (PA-to-aorta [PA/A] ratio, eERVVI-to-eELVVI [eRV/eLV] ratio, eERVVI, eELVVI, eETVVI) and clinical measures of asthma severity were assessed by Pearson correlation, and associations with asthma severity and exacerbation rate were evaluated by multivariable linear and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Asthma severity was associated with smaller ventricular volumes. For example, those with severe asthma had 36.1 mL/m<sup>2</sup> smaller eETVVI than healthy control subjects (P = .003) and 14.1 mL/m<sup>2</sup> smaller eETVVI than those with mild/moderate disease (P = .011). Smaller ventricular volumes were also associated with a higher rate of asthma exacerbations, both retrospectively and prospectively. For example, those with an eETVVI less than the median had a 57% higher rate of exacerbations during follow-up than those with eETVVI greater than the median (P = .020). Neither PA/A nor eRV/eLV was associated with asthma severity or exacerbations. In patients with asthma, smaller cardiac ventricular size may be associated with more severe disease and a higher rate of asthma exacerbations.

We sought to develop a continuous measure of asthma severity, the Asthma Severity Scoring System (ASSESS), for adolescents and adults, incorporating domains of asthma control, lung function, medications, and exacerbations. Baseline and 36-month longitudinal data from participants in phase 3 of the Severe Asthma Research Program (NCT01606826) were used. Scale properties, responsiveness, and a minimally important difference were determined. External replication was performed in participants enrolled in the Severe Asthma Research Program phase 1/2. The utility of ASSESS for detecting treatment response was explored in participants undergoing corticosteroid responsiveness testing with intramuscular triamcinolone and participants receiving biologics. ASSESS scores ranged from 0 to 20 (8.78 ± 3.9; greater scores reflect worse severity) and differed among 5 phenotypic groups. Measurement properties were acceptable. ASSESS was responsive to changes in quality of life with a minimally important difference of 2, with good specificity for outcomes of asthma improvement and worsening but poor sensitivity. Replication analyses yielded similar results, with a 2-point decrease (improvement) associated with improvements in quality of life. Participants with a 2-point or greater decrease (improvement) in ASSESS scores also had greater improvement in lung function and asthma control after triamcinolone, but these differences were limited to phenotypic clusters 3, 4, and 5. Participants treated with biologics also had a 2-point or greater decrease (improvement) in ASSESS scores overall.

We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples and was concordant with other serologic assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% more than 7 days after symptom onset. The CoV2T assay was robust to icterus and lipemia but had interference from significant hemolysis. The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, the use of the CoV2T and other serologic assays in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 is unknown and must be evaluated in future studies.","Antibodies, Viral|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|COVID-19 Testing|Clinical Laboratory Techniques|Coronavirus|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|IgG|IgM|Immunoassay|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS CoV-2 antibody|SARS-CoV-2|Sensitivity and Specificity|Serologic Tests|Serology|alidation","Garnett, Emily|Jung, Joanna|Tam, Estella|Rajapakshe, Deepthi|Cheney, Stephen|Brown, Cameron|Cao, Jing|Muldrew, Kenneth|Singh, Ila|Versalovic, James|Devaraj, Sridevi",American journal of clinical pathology,Journal Article|Validation Study,2020,HD105593,1R61HD105593-01,phs002585.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,3.0,"The publication abstract describes the validation of a serological assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

In addition to synaptic interactions, central processing is also influenced by the ion channel composition of individual neurons. For example, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels such as outward K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>A</sub>) can modify the integrative properties of neurons. <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> currents are prevalent in rNST projection cells but are also found to a lesser extent in GABAergic interneurons. However, characterization of the kinetic properties of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub>, the molecular basis of these currents, as well as the consequences of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> on spiking properties of identified rNST cells is lacking. Here, we show that <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in rNST GABAergic (G+) and non-GABAergic (G-) neurons share a common molecular basis. In both cell types, there was a reduction in <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> following treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTx3. However, the kinetics of activation and inactivation of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in the two cell types were different with G- neurons having significantly more negative half-maximal activation and inactivation values. Likewise, under current clamp, G- cells had significantly longer delays to spike initiation in response to a depolarizing stimulus preceded by a hyperpolarizing prepulse. Computational modeling and dynamic clamp suggest that differences in the activation half-maximum may account for the differences in delay. We further observed evidence for a window current under both voltage clamp and current clamp protocols. We speculate that the location of Kv4.3 channels on dendrites, together with a window current for <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> at rest, serves to regulate excitatory afferent inputs.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Here, we demonstrate that the transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> occurs in both GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons via Kv4.3 channels in the rostral (gustatory) solitary nucleus. Although found in both cell types, <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> is more prevalent in non-GABAergic cells; a larger conductance at more negative potentials leads to a greater impact on spike initiation compared with GABAergic neurons. An <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> window current further suggests that <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> can regulate excitatory afferent input to the nucleus.","Animals|Electrophysiological Phenomena|Female|GABAergic Neurons|Interneurons|Male|Mice|Mice, Transgenic|Shal Potassium Channels|Solitary Nucleus|Taste Perception|brain stem|computational model|dynamic clamp|mouse|taste","Chen, Z|Boxwell, A|Conte, C|Haas, T|Harley, A|Terman, D H|Travers, S P|Travers, J B",Journal of neurophysiology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2020,DC016112,3R01DC016112-04S1,phs002642.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the characterization of Kv4 channels in GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons of the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), which is involved in gustatory processing.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current ""breakthrough"" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated. Nevertheless, conceptual understanding of ""the severe asthmas"" has evolved dramatically in a mere 25 years, leading to dramatic improvements in the lives of many.","Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Anti-Asthmatic Agents|Antibodies, Monoclonal|Asthma|Biomarkers|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Molecular Targeted Therapy|Phenotype|Severity of Illness Index|asthma|biologic therapy|cytokines|eosinophils|type 2 asthma","Wenzel, Sally E",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",2021,HL146002,3U01HL146002-04S2,phs002689.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses severe asthma phenotypes, biomarkers, and treatments, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing rapid saliva-based COVID-19 tests.

In particular, OMP, a small cytoplasmic protein, marks mature ORNs and is also expressed in the neurons of other nasal chemosensory systems: the vomeronasal organ, the septal organ of Masera, and the Grueneberg ganglion. While its expression pattern was more easily established, OMP's function remained relatively vague. To date, most of the work to understand OMP's role has been done using mice lacking OMP. This mostly phenomenological work has shown that OMP is involved in sharpening the odorant response profile and in quickening odorant response kinetics of ORNs and that it contributes to targeting of ORN axons to the olfactory bulb to refine the glomerular response map. Increasing evidence shows that OMP acts at the early stages of olfactory transduction by modulating the kinetics of cAMP, the second messenger of olfactory transduction. However, how this occurs at a mechanistic level is not understood, and it might also not be the only mechanism underlying all the changes observed in mice lacking OMP. Recently, OMP has been detected outside the nose, including the brain and other organs. Although no obvious logic has become apparent regarding the underlying commonality between nasal and extranasal expression of OMP, a broader approach to diverse cellular systems might help unravel OMP's functions and mechanisms of action inside and outside the nose.",Animals|Olfactory Marker Protein|Olfactory Receptor Neurons|Olfactory bulb|Olfactory marker protein|Olfactory receptor neurons|Signal transduction|Vertebrates,"Dibattista, Michele|Al Koborssy, Dolly|Genovese, Federica|Reisert, Johannes",Cell and tissue research,Journal Article|Review,2021,DC019578,1U01DC019578-01,phs002699.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the functional relevance of olfactory marker protein (OMP) in the vertebrate olfactory system, focusing on its role in olfactory transduction and neuronal development.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been the dominant sequencing approach to identify genetic variants in recent decades, but most studies focus on variants on the nuclear genome. Whole genome sequencing is also costly and time consuming. Sequencing specifically targeted for mtDNA is commonly used in the diagnostic settings and has lower costs. However, there is a lack of pairwise comparisons between these two sequencing approaches for calling mtDNA variants on a population basis. In this study, we compared WGS and mtDNA-targeted sequencing (targeted-seq) in analyzing mitochondrial DNA from 1499 participants recruited into the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). Our study reveals that targeted-sequencing and WGS have comparable capacity to determine genotypes and to call haplogroups and homoplasmies on mtDNA. However, there exists a large variability in calling heteroplasmies, especially for low-frequency heteroplasmies, which indicates that investigators should be cautious about heteroplasmies acquired from different sequencing methods. Further research is highly desired to improve variant detection methods for mitochondrial DNA.","Asthma|DNA, Mitochondrial|Humans|Mitochondrial DNA|Targeted sequencing|Whole Genome Sequencing|Whole genome sequencing","Chen, Ruoying|Aldred, Micheala A|Xu, Weiling|Zein, Joe|Bazeley, Peter|Comhair, Suzy A A|Meyers, Deborah A|Bleecker, Eugene R|Liu, Chunyu|Erzurum, Serpil C|Hu, Bo|",Mitochondrion,"Comparative Study|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2021,HL146002,3U01HL146002-04S2,phs002689.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the comparison of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing for mitochondrial DNA, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing rapid saliva-based COVID-19 tests.

Highly variable sputum eosinophil percentages are associated with greater lung function loss than persistently elevated eosinophil percentages, but elevated neutrophils are linked to more severe asthma.<b>Objectives:</b> To examine sputum granulocyte stability or variability longitudinally and associations with important clinical characteristics.<b>Methods:</b> The SARP III (Severe Asthma Research Program III) cohort underwent comprehensive phenotype characterization at baseline and annually over 3 years. Adult subjects with acceptable sputum levels were assigned to one of three longitudinal sputum groups: eosinophils predominantly <2%, eosinophils predominantly ≥2%, or highly variable eosinophil percentages (>2 SDs determined from independent, repeated baseline eosinophil percentages). Subjects were similarly assigned to one of three longitudinal neutrophil groups with a 50% cut point.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> The group with predominantly <2% sputum eosinophils had the highest lung function (prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, <i>P</i> < 0.01; FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, <i>P</i> < 0.001) at baseline and throughout 3 years compared with other eosinophil groups. Healthcare use did not differ, although the highly variable eosinophil group reported more asthma exacerbations at Year 3. Longitudinal neutrophil groups showed few differences.

We aimed to assess whether quantitative computed tomography (qCT) metrics are associated with longitudinal decline in lung function and morbidity in asthma. We analyzed 205 qCT scans of adult patients with asthma and calculated baseline markers of airway remodeling, lung density, and pointwise regional change in lung volume (Jacobian measures) for each participant. Using multivariable regression models, we then assessed the association of qCT measurements with the outcomes of future change in lung function, future exacerbation rate, and changes in validated measurements of morbidity. Greater baseline wall area percent (β = -0.15 [95% CI = -0.26 to -0.05]; P < .01), hyperinflation percent (β = -0.25 [95% CI = -0.41 to -0.09]; P < .01), and Jacobian gradient measurements (cranial-caudal β = 10.64 [95% CI = 3.79-17.49]; P < .01; posterior-anterior β = -9.14, [95% CI = -15.49 to -2.78]; P < .01) were associated with more severe future lung function decline. Additionally, greater wall area percent (rate ratio = 1.06 [95% CI = 1.01-1.10]; P = .02) and air trapping percent (rate ratio =1.01 [95% CI = 1.00-1.02]; P = .03), as well as lower decline in the Jacobian determinant mean (rate ratio = 0.58 [95% CI = 0.41-0.82]; P < .01) and Jacobian determinant standard deviation (rate ratio = 0.52 [95% CI = 0.32-0.85]; P = .01), were associated with a greater rate of future exacerbations. However, imaging metrics were not associated with clinically meaningful changes in scores on validated asthma morbidity questionnaires. Baseline qCT measures of more severe airway remodeling, more small airway disease and hyperinflation, and less pointwise regional change in lung volumes were associated with future lung function decline and asthma exacerbations.","Adult|Airway Remodeling|Asthma|CT imaging|Disease Progression|Female|Forced Expiratory Volume|Humans|Lung|Male|Middle Aged|Prognosis|Tomography, X-Ray Computed|asthma exacerbations|asthma morbidity|longitudinal|lung function|severe asthma","Krings, James G|Goss, Charles W|Lew, Daphne|Samant, Maanasi|McGregor, Mary Clare|Boomer, Jonathan|Bacharier, Leonard B|Sheshadri, Ajay|Hall, Chase|Brownell, Joshua|Schechtman, Ken B|Peterson, Samuel|McEleney, Stephen|Mauger, David T|Fahy, John V|Fain, Sean B|Denlinger, Loren C|Israel, Elliot|Washko, George|Hoffman, Eric|Wenzel, Sally E|Castro, Mario|",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2021,HL146002,3U01HL146002-04S2,phs002689.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the association of quantitative CT metrics with lung function decline and asthma exacerbations, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing a rapid saliva-based COVID-19 test.

In commercial nurseries, asymptomatic infections of nursery stock by <i>P. ramorum</i> and other <i>Phytophthora</i> species create unacceptable risk and complicate inspection and certification programs designed to prevent introduction and spread of these pathogens. In this study, we continue development of a volatile organic compound (VOC)-based test for detecting asymptomatic infections of <i>P. ramorum</i> in <i>Rhododendron</i> sp. We confirmed detection of <i>P. ramorum</i> from volatiles collected from asymptomatic root-inoculated <i>Rhododendron</i> plants in a nursery setting, finding that the VOC profile of infected plants is detectably different from that of healthy plants, when measured from both ambient VOC emissions and VOCs extracted from leaf material. Predicting infection status was successful from ambient volatiles, which had a mean area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.71 ± 0.17, derived from corresponding receiver operating characteristic curves from an extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis. This finding compares with that of extracted leaf volatiles, which resulted in a lower AUC value of 0.51 ± 0.21.

Whole blood mRNA transcriptome profiles of 13 neonates with HLHS before and after their first palliative surgery were analyzed to determine differentially expressed genes and pathways. The median age and weight at surgery were 4 days and 3.2 kg, respectively. Of the 13 patients, 8 developed LCOS. There was no significant difference between CPB, aortic cross clamp, deep hypothermic cardiac arrest times between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not. Upon comparing differential gene expression profiles between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not in pre-operative samples, 1 gene was up-regulated and 13 were down regulated. In the post-operative samples, 4 genes were up-regulated, and 4 genes were down regulated when patients that develop LCOS were compared to those that do not. When comparing post-operative samples to pre-operative samples in the patients that do not develop LCOS, 1484 genes were up-regulated, and 1388 genes were down regulated; while patients that developed LCOS had 2423 up-regulated genes, and 2414 down regulated genes for the same pre to post-operative comparison. Pathway analysis revealed differential regulation of inflammatory pathways (IL signaling, PDGF, NOTCH1, NGF, GPCR) and metabolic pathways (heme metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, protein metabolism including amino acid and derivatives, fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain). By identifying altered transcriptome profiles related to inflammation and metabolism in neonates with HLHS who develop LCOS after CPB, this study opens for exploration novel pathways and potential therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.","Cardiac Surgical Procedures|Cardiopulmonary Bypass|Female|Humans|Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome|Infant, Newborn|Male|Metabolome|Prospective Studies|Transcriptome","Jain, Parag N|Robertson, Matthew|Lasa, Javier J|Shekerdemian, Lara|Guffey, Danielle|Zhang, Yuhao|Lingappan, Krithika|Checchia, Paul|Coarfa, Cristian",Scientific reports,"Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Observational Study|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2021,HD105593,1R61HD105593-01,phs002585.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,2.0,"The publication abstract focuses on transcriptome profiles in neonates with congenital heart disease after cardiac surgery, specifically examining inflammatory and metabolic pathways.

Clean rooms have stringent methods of air-filtration and cleaning to minimize microbial contamination for exoplanetary research and minimize the risk of human pathogens, but they are not sterile. Clean rooms make a selective environment for microorganisms that tolerate such cleaning methods. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the microbial cargo through sequencing and culture-dependent protocols. However, there is not a standardized metagenomic workflow nor analysis pipeline for spaceflight hardware cleanroom samples to identify microbial contamination. Additionally, current identification methods fail to characterize and profile the risk of low-abundance microorganisms. A comprehensive metagenomic framework to characterize microorganisms relevant for planetary protection in multiple cleanroom classifications (from ISO-5 to ISO-8.5) and sample types (surface, filters, and debris collected via vacuum devices) was developed. Fifty-one metagenomic samples from SAF clean rooms were sequenced and analyzed to identify microbes that could potentially survive spaceflight based on their microbial features and whether the microbes expressed any metabolic activity or growth. Additionally, an auxiliary testing was performed to determine the repeatability of our techniques and validate our analyses. We find evidence that JPL clean rooms carry microbes with attributes that may be problematic in space missions for their documented ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as psychrophilia and ability to form biofilms, spore-forming capacity, radiation resistance, and desiccation resistance. Samples from ISO-5 standard had lower microbial diversity than those conforming to ISO-6 or higher filters but still carried a measurable microbial load. Although the extensive cleaning processes limit the number of microbes capable of withstanding clean room condition, it is important to quantify thresholds and detect organisms that can inform ongoing Planetary Protection goals, provide a biological baseline for assembly facilities, and guide future mission planning.

It is currently possible to identify and measure pulmonary pathologic changes before these are obvious even to patients or depicted on conventional morphologic images. Here, key technological advances are described, including multiparametric CT image processing methods, inhaled hyperpolarized and fluorinated gas MRI, and four-dimensional free-breathing CT and MRI methods to measure regional ventilation, perfusion, gas exchange, and biomechanics. The basic anatomic and physiologic underpinnings of these pulmonary functional imaging techniques are explained.

Studies show that the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-S-1-S) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-S) bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which is clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: <b>1)</b> low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients); <b>2)</b> low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and <b>3)</b> hACE2Tg mice do not develop strong clinical disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in contrast to SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronaviruses is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2-S. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147Tg mouse model in the NOD- <i>scid</i> IL2Rgamma <sup>null</sup> (NSG) background. In this hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed following the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of CD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 model. In addition, the hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations with immunosuppressed conditions. The hCD147Tg-NSG mouse mode can serve as an additional animal model for interrogate whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.",,"Badeti, Saiaditya|Tseng, Hsiang-Chi|Romanienko, Peter|Yehia, Ghassan|Liu, Dongfang",Research square,Journal Article|Preprint,2021,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,2.0,"The publication abstract describes the development of a transgenic mouse model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses.

However, the majority of microbiome works dedicated to the public transit air are limited to amplicon sequencing, and our knowledge regarding the functional potentials and the repertoire of resistance genes (i.e. resistome) is limited. Furthermore, current air microbiome investigations on public transit systems are focused on single cities, and a multi-city assessment of the public transit air microbiome will allow a greater understanding of whether and how broad environmental, building, and anthropogenic factors shape the public transit air microbiome in an international scale. Therefore, in this study, the public transit air microbiomes and resistomes of six cities across three continents (Denver, Hong Kong, London, New York City, Oslo, Stockholm) were characterized. City was the sole factor associated with public transit air microbiome differences, with diverse taxa identified as drivers for geography-associated functional potentials, concomitant with geographical differences in species- and strain-level inferred growth profiles. Related bacterial strains differed among cities in genes encoding resistance, transposase, and other functions. Sourcetracking estimated that human skin, soil, and wastewater were major presumptive resistome sources of public transit air, and adjacent public transit surfaces may also be considered presumptive sources. Large proportions of detected resistance genes were co-located with mobile genetic elements including plasmids.

Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task (subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets. We evaluate the performance using three real-world healthcare datasets with applications to multi-stage disease progression diagnosis.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of the syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), as well as human ACE2 expression vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully. Δ19-S mRNA may represent a safer mRNA vaccine design in the future.",ACE2|COVID-19|Cell fusion|Cell hybrid|SARS-CoV-2|Spike protein|Syncytia,"Wang, Xuening|Chen, Chih-Hsiung|Badeti, Saiaditya|Cho, Jong Hyun|Naghizadeh, Alireza|Wang, Ziren|Liu, Dongfang",Cell & bioscience,Journal Article,2021,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,2.0,"The publication abstract discusses the role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in cell fusion and its implications for vaccine design.

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in treating COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its various mutants. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAbs) that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and is therefore more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G, N501Y, and E484K mutants. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein <i>in vitro</i> and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently reported CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.","A549 Cells|CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)|COVID-19|E484K variant|Gene Expression Regulation|Hep G2 Cells|Humans|Killer Cells, Natural|N501Y variant|NK cells|Receptors, Chimeric Antigen|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|off-the-shelf","Ma, Minh Tuyet|Badeti, Saiaditya|Chen, Chih-Hsiung|Kim, James|Choudhary, Alok|Honnen, Bill|Reichman, Charles|Calianese, David|Pinter, Abraham|Jiang, Qingkui|Shi, Lanbo|Zhou, Renping|Xu, Huanbin|Li, Qingsheng|Gause, William|Liu, Dongfang",Frontiers in immunology,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2021,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on CAR-NK cell therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that focus on developing biosensing and detection technologies for COVID-19.

Here, we study if coupling high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes with variant analysis can resolve strains from local transmission that have identical consensus genome. We analyzed 24 samples collected over four days in January 2020 at a large university in the US. We amplified complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genomic segments followed by Illumina sequencing. We identified consensus complete HA and NA segments using BLASTn and performed variant analysis on strains whose HA and NA segments were 100% similar. Twelve of the 24 samples were PCR positive, and we detected complete HA and/or NA segments by de novo assembly in 83.33% (10/12) of them. Similarity and phylogenetic analysis showed that 70% (7/10) of the strains were distinct while the remaining 30% had identical consensus sequences. These three samples also had IAV and IBV co-infection. However, subsequent variant analysis showed that they had distinct variant profiles. While the IAV HA of one sample had no variant, another had a T663C mutation and another had both C1379T and C1589A. In this study, we showed that HTS coupled with variant analysis of only HA and NA genes can help resolve variants that are closely related.

In microfluidics, acoustic tweezers typically use an array of sources to create standing wave patterns that can trap and move objects in ways constrained by the limited complexity of the acoustic wave field. Here, we demonstrate spatially complex particle trapping and manipulation inside a boundary-free chamber using a single pair of sources and an engineered structure outside the chamber that we call a shadow waveguide. The shadow waveguide creates a tightly confined, spatially complex acoustic field inside the chamber without requiring any interior structure that would interfere with net flow or transport.

Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant<sup>5</sup>), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526.

We performed a prospective longitudinal cohort study evaluating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) IgG positivity along with consistent clinical symptoms in patients with IBD receiving infliximab or vedolizumab. Serum was also obtained following immunization with approved vaccines. The IgG antibody to the spike protein binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assayed with a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using flow cytometry. A sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein onto a lentivirus and measures pseudoviral entry into ACE2-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells was used. There were 436 patients enrolled (mean age, 17 years, range 2-26 years; 58% male; 71% Crohn's disease, 29% ulcerative colitis, IBD-unspecified). Forty-four (10%) of enrolled subjects had SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies. Compared to non-IBD adults (ambulatory) and hospitalized pediatric patients with PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, S-RBD IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in the IBD cohort and by 6 months post infection most patients lacked neutralizing antibody.

It maintains immune homeostasis and mediates tissue repair after injury. Inflammatory diseases of the airways are associated with failure of epithelial functions, including loss of barrier integrity that results in increased tissue permeability and immune activation; excessive mucus secretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that leads to airflow obstruction and microbial overgrowth; and dysregulation of cellular signals that promotes inflammation and alters tissue structure and airway reactivity. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in mounting appropriate cellular responses to environmental stimuli and preventing disease, using a common machinery and mechanism to regulate gene expression in epithelial cells, immune cells of hematopoietic origin, and other cellular components of the airways. Respiratory diseases are accompanied by dramatic changes in epithelial miRNA expression that drive persistent immune dysregulation.

We identified one membrane-bound protein, myeloid-associated differentiation marker (MYADM), as a candidate SP-A binding partner. Blocking MYADM on mouse and human eosinophils ex vivo prevented SP-A from inducing apoptosis; blocking MYADM in vivo led to increased persistence of eosinophilia and airway hyper-responsiveness in an ovalbumin (OVA) allergy model and increased airways resistance and mucus production in a house dust mite (HDM) asthma model. Examination of a subset of participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort revealed a significant association between epithelial expression of MYADM in asthma patients and parameters of airway inflammation, including: peripheral blood eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and the number of exacerbations in the past 12 months.

Because liver plays a pivotal role during obesity, we hypothesized that miR-181c might contribute to the pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. Therefore, we used miR-181c/d-/- mice to study the role of miR-181c in hepatocyte lipogenesis during diet-induced obesity. The mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, during which indirect calorimetric measurements were made. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. We found that miR-181c/d-/- mice were not protected against all metabolic consequences of HF exposure. After 26 weeks, the miR-181c/d-/- mice had a significantly higher body fat percentage than did wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d-/- mice. miR-181c/d-/- mice fed the HF diet had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels than did WT mice fed the same diet. qPCR data showed that several genes regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were more upregulated in miR-181c/d-/- liver than in WT liver.

We retrospectively reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG antibodies measured following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at our pediatric heart transplant (HTx) center. Among patients (median age 17.1 years) in whom antibody testing was performed (median 118 days post-vaccine completion), a SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG antibody was detected in 28 of 40 (70%) post-HTx recipients (median antibody level 10.9 AU/ml). Neutropenia, diabetes mellitus, and previous use of rituximab were associated with absence of a detectable antibody. All 7 post-HTx patients with a known pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 viral infection had a detectable SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG. All 12 vaccinated pre-HTx patients had a detectable antibody (median antibody level 11.6 AU/ml) including 5 patients that maintained detectable antibodies post-HTx. There were no cases of myocarditis among the total of 17 pre-HTx and 81 post-HTx patients that underwent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our data suggest that a significant proportion of pediatric HTx recipients have no detectable antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and support the recommendation to complete the vaccination series prior to HTx in those pediatric patients waiting for HTx.","Adolescent|Age Factors|Antibodies, Viral|Antibody Formation|COVID-19|COVID-19 Vaccines|Child|Female|Heart Transplantation|Humans|Male|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|Young Adult|pediatric heart transplant","Spinner, Joseph A|Julien, Christopher L|Olayinka, Lily|Dreyer, William J|Bocchini, Claire E|Munoz, Flor M|Devaraj, Sridevi",The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,HD105593,1R61HD105593-01,phs002585.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,3.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pediatric heart transplant recipients, which is not directly related to the objectives of the funding opportunity and grant abstract.

Inflammation resolution is an active series of biologic processes orchestrated by a family of bioactive specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from essential omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this review, we highlight recent findings on dysregulated inflammation resolution in common respiratory diseases and recent literature on SPM generation with PUFA dietary supplementation with relevance to diseases of respiratory inflammation. Human studies and preclinical models of diseases of lung inflammation have revealed disequilibrium in the levels of pro-inflammatory versus pro-resolving mediators. Recent studies identified actions for SPMs on regulating prophlogistic host responses and stimulating inflammation resolution pathways in inflammatory respiratory diseases. Dietary marine oils are enriched in PUFAs and contain parent omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and precursors for conversion to SPMs. Nutritional supplementation with fish oils can boost SPM levels and offer a therapeutic approach targeting inflammation resolution pathways for diseases of lung inflammation.","COVID-19|Fatty Acids, Omega-3|Fatty Acids, Omega-6|Fish Oils|Humans|Inflammation|SARS-CoV-2","Cagnina, R Elaine|Duvall, Melody G|Nijmeh, Julie|Levy, Bruce D",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review",2022,HL146002,3U01HL146002-04S2,phs002689.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in respiratory diseases, focusing on inflammation resolution and dietary supplementation.

At multiple stages during its complex life cycle, P. falciparum expresses several essential proteins tethered to its surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for biological processes such as parasite egress and reinvasion of host red blood cells. Targeting this pathway therapeutically has the potential to broadly impact parasite development across several life stages. Here, we characterize an upstream component of parasite GPI anchor biosynthesis, the putative phosphomannomutase (PMM) (EC 5.4.2.8), HAD5 (PF3D7_1017400). We confirmed the PMM and phosphoglucomutase activities of purified recombinant HAD5 by developing novel linked enzyme biochemical assays. By regulating the expression of HAD5 in transgenic parasites with a TetR-DOZI-inducible knockdown system, we demonstrated that HAD5 is required for malaria parasite egress and erythrocyte reinvasion, and we assessed the role of HAD5 in GPI anchor synthesis by autoradiography of radiolabeled glucosamine and thin layer chromatography. Finally, we determined the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of HAD5 and identified a substrate analog that specifically inhibits HAD5 compared to orthologous human PMMs in a time-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway is exceptionally sensitive to inhibition in parasites and that HAD5 has potential as a specific, multistage antimalarial target.","Animals|Erythrocytes|Glycosylphosphatidylinositols|Humans|Malaria, Falciparum|Phosphotransferases (Phosphomutases)|Plasmodium falciparum|Protozoan Proteins|carbohydrate metabolism|crystal structure|drug development|glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor|haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)|malaria|parasite|phosphomannomutase","Frasse, Philip M|Miller, Justin J|Polino, Alexander J|Soleimani, Ebrahim|Zhu, Jian-She|Jakeman, David L|Jez, Joseph M|Goldberg, Daniel E|Odom John, Audrey R",The Journal of biological chemistry,Journal Article,2022,HD105594,1R61HD105594-01,phs002603.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the enzymatic and structural characterization of HAD5, a phosphomannomutase in malaria-causing parasites.

We investigated the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA vaccines in 33 subjects vaccinated with either vaccine class 5 months earlier on average. After controlling for the time since vaccination, Spike-binding antibody and neutralizing antibody levels were higher in the mRNA-vaccinated subjects, while no significant differences in antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses were observed between the two groups.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand BMP4 is being examined as a potential therapeutic for GBMs because it induces differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) to an astrocyte phenotype. ID1 is reported to promote self-renewal and inhibit CSC differentiation. In most cancers, ID1 is transcriptionally upregulated by BMP4 promoting invasion and stemness. This conflicting data bring into question whether BMP signaling is growth suppressive or growth promoting in GBMs. We utilized BMP inhibitors DMH1, JL5, and Ym155 to examine the role of BMP signaling on the growth of GBMs. DMH1 targets BMP type 1 receptors whereas JL5 inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Ym155 does not bind the BMP receptors but rather inhibits BMP signaling by inducing the degradation of BMPR2. We show that JL5, DMH1, and Ym155 decreased the expression of ID1 in SD2 and U87 cells. JL5 and Ym155 also decreased the expression of BMPR2 and its downstream target inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. JL5 treatment resulted in significant cell death and suppressed self-renewal to a greater extent than that induced by BMP4 ligand. The lysosome inhibitor chloroquine increases the localization of BMPR2 to the plasma membrane enhancing JL5-induced downregulation of ID1 and cell death in SD2 cells. We show that BMP signaling is growth promoting in GBMs. These studies suggest the need for development of BMP inhibitors and evaluation as potential therapeutic for GBMs.",BMP|BMP inhibitors|BMPR2|Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4|Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors|Bone Morphogenetic Proteins|Cancer stem cells|Glioblastoma|Humans|ID1|Ligands|Signal Transduction,"Kaye, Joel|Mondal, Arindam|Foty, Ramsey|Jia, Dongxuan|Langenfeld, John",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,Journal Article,2022,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses the suppression of glioblastoma cell growth using bone morphogenetic protein receptor inhibitors, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing a breathalyzer diagnostic platform for COVID-19.

Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different ""off-the-shelf"" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

We transfected HASM with a range of RGS2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) concentrations and determined RGS2 protein expression by Western blot analysis and intracellular calcium flux induced by histamine (a Gαq-coupled H1 receptor bronchoconstrictive agonist). We conducted regression-based genotype association analyses of RGS2 variants from 611 patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program 3.

However, the frequency and impact of CFTR variation among individuals with asthma is unknown. To determine whether potentially pathogenic CFTR variants associate with disease severity and whether individuals with two potentially pathogenic variants exist in a severe asthma-enriched cohort. We analyzed sequencing data spanning a 190.5Kb region of CFTR in participants from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP1-3). Potentially pathogenic, rare CFTR variants (frequency < 0.05) were classified as CF-causing or of varying clinical consequences (VVCC) (CFTR2. org). Regression-based models tested for association between CFTR genotypes (0-2 potentially pathogenic variants) and severity outcomes. Of 1401 participants, 9.5% (134) had one potentially pathogenic variant, occurring more frequently in non-Hispanic white (NHW, 10.1% [84 of 831]) compared to African American individuals (AA, 5.2% [22 of 426]). We found ≥2 potentially pathogenic CFTR variants in 1.4% (19); 0.5% (4) of NHW and 2.8% (12) of AA. Potentially pathogenic CFTR variant genotypes (≥1 or ≥2 variants) were not cumulatively associated with lung function or exacerbations. In NHW, we found three F508del compound heterozygotes with F508del and a VVCC (two 5 T; TG12[c.1210-11 T > G] and one Arg1070Trp) and a homozygote for the VVCC, 5 T; TG12. We found potentially pathogenic CFTR variants within a severe asthma-enriched cohort, including three compound heterozygote genotypes variably associated with CF in NHW individuals. These findings provide the rationale for CFTR sequencing and phenotyping of CF-related traits in individuals with severe asthma.","Asthma|CF-Asthma Overlap|CFTR|Cystic Fibrosis|Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator|Humans|Mutation|Sequence Analysis, DNA|cystic fibrosis|heterozygote carriers","Izquierdo, Manuel E|Marion, Chad R|Moore, Wendy C|Raraigh, Karen S|Taylor-Cousar, Jennifer L|Cutting, Gary R|Ampleford, E|Hawkins, Gregory A|Zein, Joe|Castro, M|Denlinger, Loren C|Erzurum, Serpil C|Fahy, John V|Israel, Elliot|Jarjour, Nizar N|Mauger, David|Levy, Bruce D|Wenzel, Sally E|Woodruff, Prescott|Bleecker, Eugene R|Meyers, Deborah A|Ortega, Victor E",Pediatric pulmonology,"Letter|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,HL146002,3U01HL146002-04S2,phs002689.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the analysis of CFTR gene variants in individuals with severe asthma, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that are centered on developing rapid saliva-based COVID-19 tests.

Purpose To determine whether quantitative CT (qCT) could help distinguish between clinical asthma phenotypes. Materials and Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted with the use of qCT images (maximal bronchodilation at total lung capacity [TLC], or inspiration, and functional residual capacity [FRC], or expiration) from the cluster phenotypes of SARP participants (cluster 1: minimal disease; cluster 2: mild, reversible; cluster 3: obese asthma; cluster 4: severe, reversible; cluster 5: severe, irreversible) enrolled between September 2001 and December 2015. Airway morphometry was performed along standard paths (RB1, RB4, RB10, LB1, and LB10). Corresponding voxels from TLC and FRC images were mapped with use of deformable image registration to characterize disease probability maps (DPMs) of functional small airway disease (fSAD), voxel-level volume changes (Jacobian), and isotropy (anisotropic deformation index [ADI]). The association between cluster assignment and qCT measures was evaluated using linear mixed models. Results A total of 455 participants were evaluated with cluster assignments and CT (mean age ± SD, 42.1 years ± 14.7; 270 women). Airway morphometry had limited ability to help discern between clusters. DPM fSAD was highest in cluster 5 (cluster 1 in SARP III: 19.0% ± 20.6; cluster 2: 18.9% ± 13.3; cluster 3: 24.9% ± 13.1; cluster 4: 24.1% ± 8.4; cluster 5: 38.8% ± 14.4; <i>P</i> < .001). Lower whole-lung Jacobian and ADI values were associated with greater cluster severity. Compared to cluster 1, cluster 5 lung expansion was 31% smaller (Jacobian in SARP III cohort: 2.31 ± 0.6 vs 1.61 ± 0.3, respectively, <i>P</i> < .001) and 34% more isotropic (ADI in SARP III cohort: 0.40 ± 0.1 vs 0.61 ± 0.2, <i>P</i> < .001). Within-lung Jacobian and ADI SDs decreased as severity worsened (Jacobian SD in SARP III cohort: 0.90 ± 0.4 for cluster 1; 0.79 ± 0.3 for cluster 2; 0.62 ± 0.2 for cluster 3; 0.63 ± 0.2 for cluster 4; and 0.41 ± 0.2 for cluster 5; <i>P</i> < .001).

Although three-dimensional cell culture better recapitulates the heterogeneity observed in tumor growth and extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, the physiological relevance is often contrasted with the control offered by two-dimensional cell culture. Therefore, to challenge this misconception we developed a novel microfluidic system harboring highly tunable three-dimensional EV microbioreactors (<sup>EV</sup>μBRs) to model micrometastatic EV release in breast cancer while capitalizing on the convenient, low-volume, and sterile interface provided by microfluidics. The diameter and cellular occupancy of the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs could be precisely tailored to various configurations, supporting the formation of breast cancer tumor spheroids. To immobilize the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs within a microchannel and facilitate EV extraction, oxygen inhibition in free-radical polymerization was repurposed to rapidly generate two-layer hydrodynamic traps <i>in situ</i> using a digital-micromirror device (DMD)-based ultraviolet (UV) projection system. Breast cancer tumor spheroid-derived EVs were harvested with as little as 20 μL from the microfluidic system and quantified by single-EV immunofluorescence for CD63 and CD81. Despite the low-volume extraction, differences in biomarker expression and coexpression of the tetraspanins on single EVs were observed. Furthermore, the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs were capable of recapitulating heterogeneity at a cellular and vesicular degree, indicating the utility and robustness of the microfluidic system to investigate physiologically relevant EVs in breast cancer and other disease models.",Breast Neoplasms|Cell Culture Techniques|Extracellular Vesicles|Female|Humans|Microfluidics|Microgels|Tumor Microenvironment,"Rima, Xilal Y|Zhang, Jingjing|Nguyen, Luong T H|Rajasuriyar, Aaron|Yoon, Min Jin|Chiang, Chi-Ling|Walters, Nicole|Kwak, Kwang Joo|Lee, L James|Reátegui, Eduardo",Lab on a chip,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,TR003807,1U18TR003807-01,phs002709.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,2.5,"The publication abstract describes a microfluidic system for harvesting extracellular vesicles (EVs) from breast cancer tumor spheroids, focusing on single-vesicle analysis.

The potassium current I<sub>A</sub> is one potential source of modulation. In the caudal NST, projection neurons with I<sub>A</sub> show lower fidelity to afferent stimulation compared to cells without. We explored the role of an A-type K+ current (I<sub>A</sub>) in modulating the response to afferent stimulation and GABA-mediated inhibition in the rNST using whole cell patch clamp recording in transgenic mice that expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2 H134R) in GABAergic neurons. The presence of I<sub>A</sub> was determined in current clamp and the response to electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the solitary tract was assessed before and after treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTX3. Blocking I<sub>A</sub> significantly increased the response to afferent stimulation by 53%. Using dynamic clamp to create a synthetic I<sub>A</sub> conductance, we demonstrated a significant 14% decrease in responsiveness to afferent stimulation in cells lacking I<sub>A</sub>. Because I<sub>A</sub> reduced excitability and is hyperpolarization-sensitive, we examined whether I<sub>A</sub> contributed to the inhibition resulting from optogenetic release of GABA. Although blocking I<sub>A</sub> decreased the percent suppression induced by GABA, this effect was attributable to the increased responsiveness resulting from AmmTX3, not to a change in the absolute magnitude of suppression.

This study presents the feasibility of indocyanine green-assisted near-infrared fluorescence (ICG-NIRF) dental imaging with 785-nm NIR laser in the first (ICG-NIRF-I: 700 to 1000 nm) and second (ICG-NIRF-II: 1000 to 1700 nm) NIR wavelengths. Sprague Dawley rats with different postnatal days were used as animal models. ICG, as a fluorescence agent, was delivered to dental structures by subcutaneous injection (SC) and oral administration (OA). For SC method, erupted and unerupted molars could be observed from ICG-NIRF images at a short imaging time (<1  min). ICG-NIRF-II could achieve a better image contrast in unerupted molars at 24 h after ICG injection. The OA could serve as a non-invasive method for ICG delivery; it could also cause the glow-in-dark effect in unerupted molars. For erupted molars, OA can be considered as mouthwash and exhibits outstanding performance for delivery of ICG dye; erupted molar structures could be observed at a short imaging time (<1  min) and low ICG dose (0.05  mg  /  kg). Overall, ICG-NIRF with mouthwash could perform in-vivo dental imaging in two NIR wavelengths at a short time and low ICG dose.","Animals|Fluorescence|Indocyanine Green|Mouthwashes|Optical Imaging|Rats|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|X-Rays|indocyanine green|indocyanine green delivery|mouthwash|near-infrared fluorescence dental imaging|oral administration","Li, Zhongqiang|Li, Zheng|Zaid, Waleed|Osborn, Michelle L|Li, Yanping|Yao, Shaomian|Xu, Jian",Journal of biomedical optics,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2022,AA029348,1U01AA029348-01,phs002573.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,2.0,"The publication abstract discusses the use of mouthwash for delivering indocyanine green (ICG) for near-infrared fluorescence dental imaging.

Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgamma<sup>null</sup> (NSG) background. In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model. In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states. Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice. hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice. The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.",Accessory receptor|BSG|Basigin|CD147|COVID-19|Immune responses|Knock-in mouse model|NSG|Physiological expression|SARS-CoV-2|Spike protein|Viral entry|hCD147KI,"Badeti, Saiaditya|Jiang, Qingkui|Naghizadeh, Alireza|Tseng, Hsiang-Chi|Bushkin, Yuri|Marras, Salvatore A E|Nisa, Annuurun|Tyagi, Sanjay|Chen, Fei|Romanienko, Peter|Yehia, Ghassan|Evans, Deborah|Lopez-Gonzalez, Moises|Alland, David|Russo, Riccardo|Gause, William|Shi, Lanbo|Liu, Dongfang",Cell & bioscience,Journal Article,2022,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,2.5,"The publication abstract describes the development of a mouse model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is related to the broader goals of understanding COVID-19.

Gene and protein expression defines several neutrophil clusters in COVID-19, including the emergence of low density neutrophils (LDN) that are associated with severe disease. The functional capabilities of these neutrophil clusters and correlation with gene and protein expression are unknown. To define host defense and immunosuppressive functions of normal density neutrophils (NDN) and LDN from COVID-19 patients, we recruited 64 patients with severe COVID-19 and 26 healthy donors (HD). Phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and T-cell suppression in those neutrophil subsets were measured. NDN from severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed evidence of priming with enhanced phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, and degranulation of secretory vesicles and gelatinase and specific granules, while NET formation was similar to HD NDN. COVID LDN response was impaired except for enhanced NET formation. A subset of COVID LDN with intermediate CD16 expression (CD16<sup>Int</sup> LDN) promoted T cell proliferation to a level similar to HD NDN, while COVID NDN and the CD16<sup>Hi</sup> LDN failed to stimulate T-cell activation. All 3 COVID-19 neutrophil populations suppressed stimulation of IFN-γ production, compared to HD NDN. We conclude that NDN and LDN from COVID-19 patients possess complementary functional capabilities that may act cooperatively to determine disease severity.

Without means of safe removal, these stronger adhesives are difficult to painlessly remove from the skin and may cause medical-adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to device dislodgement and further medical complications. This paper outlines the development of a high-adhesion medical tape designed for low skin trauma upon release. By warming the skin-attached tape for 10-30 s, a significant loss in adhesion was achieved. A C14/C18 copolymer was developed and combined with a selected pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) material. The addition of 1% C14/C18 copolymer yielded the largest temperature-responsive drop in surface adhesion. The adhesive film was characterized using AFM, and distinct nanodomains were identified on the exterior surface of the PSA. Our optimized formulation yielded 67% drop in adhesion when warmed to 45 °C, perhaps due to melting nanodomains weakening the adhesive-substrate boundary layer. Pilot clinical testing resulted in a significant decrease in pain when a heat pack was used for removal, giving an average pain reduction of 66%.",Adhesives|Humans|Pain|Quality of Health Care|Skin|Temperature|adhesive film|functional polymer|medical device|skin injury|temperature responsive,"Swanson, Shawn|Bashmail, Rahaf|Fellin, Christopher R|Luu, Vivian|Shires, Nicholas|Cox, Phillip A|Nelson, Alshakim|MacKenzie, Devin|Taroc, Ann-Marie|Nelson, Leonard Y|Seibel, Eric J",International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,2022,HL152401,3U01HL152401-02S1,phs002924.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,2.0,"The publication abstract describes the development of a temperature-sensitive medical tape designed to reduce skin injury during removal.

A CNN model was trained and validated over three replicates on a retrospective cohort of 4889 time-lapse embryo images. The algorithm processed embryo images for each patient and produced a unique identification key that was associated with the patient ID at a timepoint on day 3 (~ 65 hours post-insemination (hpi)) and day 5 (~ 105 hpi) forming our data library. When the algorithm evaluated embryos at a later timepoint on day 3 (~ 70 hpi) and day 5 (~ 110 hpi), it generates another key that was matched with the patient's unique key available in the library. This approach was tested using 400 patient embryo cohorts on day 3 and day 5 and number of correct embryo identifications with the CNN algorithm was measured. CNN technology matched the patient identification within random pools of 8 patient embryo cohorts on day 3 with 100% accuracy (n = 400 patients; 3 replicates). For day 5 embryo cohorts, the accuracy within random pools of 8 patients was 100% (n = 400 patients; 3 replicates).

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

However, it is not straightforward to interpret the Brier score for a prediction model since its value depends on the outcome prevalence. We decompose the Brier score into two components, the mean squares between the estimated and true underlying binary probabilities, and the variance of the binary outcome that is not reflective of the model performance. We then propose to modify the Brier score by removing the variance of the binary outcome, estimated via a general sliding window approach. We show that the new proposed measure is more sensitive for comparing different models through simulation. A standardized performance improvement measure is also proposed based on the new criterion to quantify the improvement of prediction performance.

Reduced CC16 protein concentrations in BAL and serum are associated with asthma susceptibility. <b>Objectives:</b> Few studies have investigated the relationship between CC16 and asthma progression, and none has focused on BECs. In this study, we sought to determine if CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs are associated with asthma severity. <b>Methods:</b> Association analyses between CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs (242 asthmatics and 69 control subjects) and asthma-related phenotypes in Severe Asthma Research Program were performed using a generalized linear model. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Low CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs were significantly associated with asthma susceptibility and asthma severity, high systemic corticosteroids use, high retrospective and prospective asthma exacerbations, and low pulmonary function. Low CC16 mRNA expression levels were significantly associated with high T2 inflammation biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide and sputum eosinophils). CC16 mRNA expression levels were negatively correlated with expression levels of Th2 genes (<i>IL1RL1</i>, <i>POSTN</i>, <i>SERPINB2</i>, <i>CLCA1</i>, <i>NOS2</i>, and <i>MUC5AC</i>) and positively correlated with expression levels of Th1 and inflammation genes (<i>IL12A</i> and <i>MUC5B</i>). A combination of two nontraditional T2 biomarkers (CC16 and IL-6) revealed four asthma endotypes with different characteristics of T2 inflammation, obesity, and asthma severity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings indicate that low CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs are associated with asthma susceptibility, severity, and exacerbations, partially through immunomodulation of T2 inflammation.

Global health efforts have sought to implement mass-screening programs to provide earlier detection and subsequent treatment in an effort to control transmission and improve health outcomes. However, many of the current diagnostic technologies under development are limited to fewer than 10 samples per run, which inherently restricts the screening throughput of these devices. We have developed a high throughput device called ""MINI"" that is capable of testing hundreds of samples per day at the point-of-care. MINI can utilize multiple energy sources - electricity, flame, or solar - to perform loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in a portable and robust device which is ideal for use in limited resource settings. The unique opto-electronic design of MINI minimizes the energy and space requirements of the device and maximizes the optical isolation and signal clarity, enabling point-of-care analysis of 96 unique samples at once. We show comparable performance to a commercial instrument using two different LAMP assays for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and a common housekeeping gene, GAPDH.

Although many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. To directly compare the response characteristics of both inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons, we recorded from mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. We observed that chemosensitive profiles of GABAergic taste neurons (G+<sub>TASTE</sub>) were similar to non-GABA taste neurons (G-<sub>TASTE</sub>) but had much lower response rates. We further observed a novel subpopulation of GABA cells located more ventrally in the nucleus that were unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+<sub>UNR</sub>), suggesting pathways for inhibition initiated by centrifugal sources. This preparation also allowed us to determine how optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impacted the taste responses of G-<sub>TASTE</sub> neurons. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-<sub>TASTE</sub> neurons across all qualities and chemosensitive types of neurons. Although the tuning curves of identified G-<sub>TASTE</sub> were modestly sharpened, the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.",Animals|Channelrhodopsins|DREADDs|GABAergic Neurons|Mice|Quinine|Solitary Nucleus|Sucrose|Taste|inhibitory interneurons|optogenetics|solitary nucleus|taste quality coding,"Travers, Susan P|Kalyanasundar, B|Breza, Joseph|Houser, Grace|Klimovich, Charlotte|Travers, Joseph",eNeuro,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,DC016112,3R01DC016112-04S1,phs002642.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the role of GABAergic neurons in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) in modulating taste responses.

In particular, an association between metal exposure and CVDs has become evident but causal evidence still lacks. Therefore, this symposium at the Society of Toxicology 2022 annual meeting addressed epidemiological, clinical, pre-clinical animal model-derived and mechanism-based evidence by five presentations: 1) An epidemiologic study on potential CVD risks of individuals exposed occupationally and environmentally to heavy metals; 2) Both presentations of the second and third were clinical studies focusing on the potential link between heavy metals and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by presenting altered blood metal concentrations of both non-essential and essential metals in the patients with PAH and potential therapeutic approaches; 3) Arsenic-induced atherosclerosis via inflammatory cells in mouse model; 4) Pathogenic effects on the heart by adult chronic exposure to very low-dose cadmium via epigenetic mechanisms and whole life exposure to low dose cadmium via exacerbating high-fat-diet-lipotoxicity. This symposium has brought epidemiologists, therapeutic industry, physicians, and translational scientists together to discuss the health risks of occupational and environmental exposure to heavy metals through direct cardiotoxicity and indirect disruption of homeostatic mechanisms regulating essential metals, as well as lipid levels. The data summarized by the presenters infers a potential causal link between multiple metals and CVDs and defines differences and commonalities.

Understanding neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 after vaccine breakthrough infections will provide insights into BA.2 infectivity and susceptibility to subsequent reinfection. Live virus neutralization assays were used to study immunity against Delta and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in samples from 86 individuals, 24 unvaccinated (27.9%) and 62 vaccinated (72.1%), who were infected with Delta (n = 42, 48.8%) or BA.1 (n = 44, 51.2%). Among the 62 vaccinated individuals, 39 were unboosted (62.9%), whereas 23 were boosted (37.1%). In unvaccinated infections, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the three variants were weak or undetectable, except against Delta for Delta-infected individuals. Both Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections resulted in strong nAb responses against ancestral wild-type and Delta lineages, but moderate nAb responses against BA.1 and BA.2, with similar titers between unboosted and boosted individuals. Antibody titers against BA.2 were generally higher than those against BA.1 in breakthrough infections. These results underscore the decreased immunogenicity of BA.1 compared to BA.2, insufficient neutralizing immunity against BA.2 in unvaccinated individuals, and moderate to strong neutralizing immunity induced against BA.2 in Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections.","Antibodies, Neutralizing|Antibodies, Viral|COVID-19|Humans|Omicron BA.1|Omicron BA.2|Vaccines|and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants|breakthrough infection|neutralizing antibodies|vaccine boosting","Brazer, Noah|Morris, Mary Kate|Servellita, Venice|Anglin, Khamal|Saldhi, Prachi|Garcia-Knight, Miguel|Bethancourt, Sutana|Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia|Wang, Baolin|Foresythe, Abiodun|Nguyen, Jenny|Gliwa, Amelia S|Pineda-Ramirez, Jesus|Sanchez, Ruth Diaz|Zhang, Yueyuan|Ott, Melanie|Wadford, Debra A|Andino, Raul|Kelly, J Daniel|Hanson, Carl|Chiu, Charles Y",The Journal of infectious diseases,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2022,HD105618,1R61HD105618-01,phs002781.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in vaccine breakthrough infections.

By extracting features interpretable by clinicians, we applied Gradient Boosted Decision Tree machine learning on a dataset of 2630 patients to build 240 models. Validation was performed on a geographically distinct dataset. Relative to onset, predictions were clocked as per 16 pairs of monitoring intervals and prediction times, and the outcomes were ranked. The combination of HR and Temp was found to be a minimal feature set yielding maximal predictability with area under receiver operating curve 0.94, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.90. Whereas HR and RR each directly enhance prediction, the effects of SpO<sub>2</sub> and Temp are significant only when combined with HR or RR.

Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, antimony has been less addressed. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, several metals such as lead, arsenic, and cadmium have been associated with the increased risk of CVDs. Antimony has been less addressed, but its potential link to CVDs is being gradually recognized. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> Several epidemiological studies have revealed the significant deleterious effects of antimony on the cardiovascular system in the absence or presence of other nonessential metals. There has been less focus on whether antimony alone can contribute to the pathogenesis of CVDs and the proposed mechanisms of such possible effects. This review addresses this gap in knowledge by presenting the current available evidence that highlights the potential role of antimony in the pathogenesis of CVDs, most likely <i>via</i> antimony-mediated redox dyshomeostasis. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> More direct evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies is urgently needed to evaluate the possible roles of antimony in mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic regulation in CVDs. <i>Antioxid.

Those multi-functional nanomaterials have been utilized to treat neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system (CNS) injuries in an effective and personalized manner. Even though many nanomaterials can deliver a payload and detect a biomarker of interest, only a few studies have yet to fully utilize this combined strategy to its full potential. Combining a nanomaterial's ability to facilitate targeted delivery, promote cellular proliferation and differentiation, and carry a large amount of material with various sensing approaches makes it possible to diagnose a patient selectively and sensitively while offering preventative measures or early disease-modifying strategies. By tuning the properties of an inorganic nanomaterial, the dimensionality, hydrophilicity, size, charge, shape, surface chemistry, and many other chemical and physical parameters, different types of cells in the central nervous system can be monitored, modulated, or further studies to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms.

Pharmacologic interactions between established asthma therapies and novel drug interventions for COVID-19 infection, including antivirals, biologics, and vaccines, have emerged as a critical and unanticipated issue in the clinical care of asthma. In particular, impaired metabolism of some long-acting beta-2 agonists by the cytochrome P4503A4 enzyme in the setting of antiviral treatment using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (NVM/r, brand name Paxlovid) may increase risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Although available data have documented the potential for such interactions, these issues are largely unappreciated by clinicians who treat asthma, or those dispensing COVID-19 interventions in patients who happen to have asthma. Because these drug-drug interactions have not previously been relevant to patient care, clinicians have had no guidance on management strategies to reduce potentially serious interactions between treatments for asthma and COVID-19.

Currently, air cleaning technologies lack an accepted test standard to evaluate their VOC removal performance. A protocol to evaluate the VOC removal performance of air cleaning devices was developed and piloted with two devices.

Human kidney organoids can reconstitute PKD cystogenesis in a genetically specific way, but the mechanisms underlying cystogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that subjecting organoids to fluid shear stress in a PKD-on-a-chip microphysiological system promotes cyst expansion via an absorptive rather than a secretory pathway. A diffusive static condition partially substitutes for fluid flow, implicating volume and solute concentration as key mediators of this effect. Surprisingly, cyst-lining epithelia in organoids polarize outwards towards the media, arguing against a secretory mechanism. Rather, cyst formation is driven by glucose transport into lumens of outwards-facing epithelia, which can be blocked pharmacologically. In PKD mice, glucose is imported through cysts into the renal interstitium, which detaches from tubules to license expansion. Thus, absorption can mediate PKD cyst growth in human organoids, with implications for disease mechanism and potential for therapy development.",Animals|Cysts|Epithelium|Humans|Kidney|Mice|Organoids|Polycystic Kidney Diseases,"Li, Sienna R|Gulieva, Ramila E|Helms, Louisa|Cruz, Nelly M|Vincent, Thomas|Fu, Hongxia|Himmelfarb, Jonathan|Freedman, Benjamin S",Nature communications,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,HL152401,3U01HL152401-02S1,phs002924.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses glucose absorption driving cystogenesis in a human organoid-on-chip model of polycystic kidney disease.

While many drugs reduce gastrointestinal injury, no drug directly stimulates mucosal wound healing. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, induces epithelial sheet migration. We synthesized and evaluated a water-soluble FAK-activating small molecule, M64HCl, with drug-like properties. Monolayer wound closure and Western blots measured migration and FAK phosphorylation in Caco-2 ​cells, in vitro kinase assays established FAK activation, and pharmacologic tests assessed drug-like properties. 30 ​mg/kg/day M64HCl was administered in two murine small intestine injury models for 4 days.

However, achieving biocompatibility and bioorthogonality with current synthetic methods remains a challenge. We report herein a novel surface functionalization method that proceeds chemoselectively and without a free transition metal catalyst. In this method, a coating is first formed via the tyrosinase-catalyzed putative polymerization of a tetrazine-containing catecholamine (DOPA-Tet). One or more types of molecule of interest containing <i>trans</i>-cyclooctene are then grafted onto the coating via tetrazine ligation. The entire process proceeds under physiological conditions and is suitable for grafting bioactive molecules with diverse functions and structural complexities. Utilizing this method, we functionalized material surfaces with enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase), a cyclic peptide (cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys], or c(RGDfK)), and an antibiotic (vancomycin). Colorimetric assays confirmed the maintenance of the biocatalytic activities of the grafted enzymes on the surface. We established the mammalian cytocompatibility of the functionalized materials with fibroblasts. Surface functionalization with c(RGDfK) showed improved fibroblast cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization.

This low affinity/selectivity interaction results in not only suboptimal anticancer activity but also induction of adverse effects. CD16a on NK cells binds to the antibody-coated cells, leading to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Recent clinical data have shown that the increased binding affinity between mAb Fc region and CD16a receptor is responsible for significantly improved therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the <i>objective</i> of this study was to develop a bispecific killer cell engager (BiKE) with high affinity and specificity/selectivity toward CD16a receptor for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy. To engineer BiKE, a llama was immunized, then high binding anti-CD16a and anti-HER2 VHH clones were isolated using phage display. ELISA, flow cytometry, and biolayer interferometry (BLI) data showed that the isolated anti-CD16a VHH has high affinity (sub-nanomolar) toward CD16a antigen without cross-reactivity with CD16b-NA1 on neutrophils or CD32b on B cells. Similarly, the data showed that the isolated anti-HER2 VHH has high affinity/specificity toward HER2 antigen. Using a semi-flexible linker, anti-HER2 VHH was recombinantly fused with anti-CD16a VHH to create BiKE:HER2/CD16a. Then, the ability of BiKE:HER2/CD16a to activate NK cells to release cytokines and kill HER2<sup>+</sup> cancer cells was measured. As effector cells, both high-affinity haNK92 (CD16<sup>+</sup>, V176) and low-affinity laNK92 (CD16<sup>+</sup>, F176) cells were used. The data showed that the engineered BiKE:HER2/CD16a activates haNK92 and laNK92 cells to release cytokines much greater than best-in-class mAbs in the clinic.

Although effective for most, a subset of patients with asthma experience CS-resistant disease despite receiving high-dose medication. We sought to investigate the transcriptomic response of bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) to inhaled CSs. Independent component analysis was performed on datasets, detailing the transcriptional response of BECs to CS treatment. The expression of these CS-response components was examined in 2 patient cohorts and investigated in relation to clinical parameters. Supervised learning was used to predict BEC CS responses using peripheral blood gene expression. We identified a signature of CS response that was closely correlated with CS use in patients with asthma. Participants could be separated on the basis of CS-response genes into groups with high and low signature expression. Patients with low expression of CS-response genes, particularly those with a severe asthma diagnosis, showed worse lung function and quality of life. These individuals demonstrated enrichment for T-lymphocyte infiltration in endobronchial brushings.

Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances on the inner walls of arteries. It can affect arteries of heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis and kidney, resulting in ischemic heart disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease. Laser-based treatment techniques like laser atherectomy can be used to treat many common atherosclerostic diseases. However, the use of laser-based treatment remains limited due to the high risk of complications and low efficiency in removing atherosclerostic plaques as compared with other treatment methods. In this study, we developed a technology that used high intensity focused ultrasound to assist laser treatment in the removal of the lipid core of atherosclerotic plaques.<i>Approach</i>. The fundamental mechanism to disrupt atherosclerostic plaque was to enhance the mechanical effect of cavitation during laser/ultrasound therapy. To promote cavitation, spatiotemporally synchronized ultrasound bursts of 2% duty cycle at 0.5 MHz and nanosecond laser pulses at 532 nm wavelength were used. Experiments were first performed on pig belly fat samples to titrate ultrasound and laser parameters. Then, experiments were conducted on human plaque samples, where the lipid depositions of the plaques were targeted.<i>Main results</i>. Our results showed that fat tissue could be removed with an ultrasound peak negative pressure (PNP) of 2.45 MPa and a laser radiant exposure as low as 3.2 mJ mm<sup>-2</sup>. The lipid depositions on the atherosclerostic plaques were removed with laser radiant exposure of 16 mJ mm<sup>-2</sup>in synchronizing with an ultrasound PNP of 5.4 MPa. During all the experiments, laser-only and ultrasound-only control treatments at the same energy levels were not effective in removing the lipid.<i>Significance</i>. The results demonstrated that the addition of ultrasound could effectively reduce the needed laser power for atherosclerotic plaque removal, which will potentially improve treatment safety and efficiency of current laser therapies.","Animals|Feasibility Studies|Humans|Laser Therapy|Lasers|Lipids|Plaque, Atherosclerotic|Swine|atherosclerosis|cavitation|excimer laser coronary angioplasty|ultrasound","Singh, Rohit|Ebersole, Koji C|Yang, Xinmai",Physics in medicine and biology,Journal Article,2023,HL152410,1U01HL152410-01,phs002522.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on a feasibility study using ultrasound-assisted laser ablation to remove lipid deposition in atherosclerotic plaques.

Questionnaires were completed by all study subjects (20 PAH patients and 10 healthy controls) on smoking, metal exposure risks, metal supplements, and vegetable consumptions.

Abnormalities in skeletal muscle (SM) metabolism have been identified in patients with HF. However, the underlying mechanisms of IR development in SM in HF are poorly understood. Herein, we hypothesize that HF upregulates miR-133b in SM and in turn alters glucose metabolism and the propensity toward IR. Mitochondria isolated from SM of mice with HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) showed lower respiration and downregulation of muscle-specific components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1), and fumarate compared with those from control animals. RNA-Seq and subsequent qPCR validation confirmed upregulation of SM-specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-133b, in TAC versus sham animals. miR-133b overexpression alone resulted in significantly lower mitochondrial respiration, cellular glucose uptake, and glycolysis along with lower ATP production and cellular energy reserve compared with the scramble (Scr) in C2C12 cells. miR-133b binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of <i>KLF15</i>, the transcription factor for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4. Overexpression of miR-133b lowers GLUT4 and lowers pAkt in presence of insulin in C2C12 cells. Finally, lowering miR-133b in primary skeletal myocytes isolated from TAC mice using antagomir-133b reversed the changes in KLF15, GLUT4, and AMPD1 compared with the scramble-transfected myocytes. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for SM miR-133b in altered glucose metabolism in HF and suggest the therapeutic potential in HF to improve glucose uptake and glycolysis by restoring GLUT4 abundance. The data uncover a novel mechanism for IR and ultimately SM metabolic abnormalities in patients with HF.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Heart failure is associated with systemic insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the skeletal muscle, the major peripheral site of glucose utilization, we observe an increase in miR-133b in heart failure mice, which reduces the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4), glucose uptake, and metabolism in C2C12 and in myocytes. The antagomir for miR-133b restores GLUT4 protein and markers of metabolism in skeletal myocytes from heart failure mice demonstrating that miR-133b is an exciting target for systemic insulin resistance in heart failure and an important player in the cross talk between the heart and the periphery in the heart failure syndrome.","Animals|Antagomirs|Glucose|Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative|Glucose Transporter Type 4|Heart Failure|Insulin|Insulin Resistance|Mice|MicroRNAs|Muscle, Skeletal|heart failure|miR-133b|microRNA|mitochondria|skeletal muscle","Velasquez, Fernanda Carrizo|Roman, Barbara|Hernández-Ochoa, Erick O|Leppo, Michelle K|Truong, Sharon K|Steenbergen, Charles|Schneider, Martin F|Weiss, Robert G|Das, Samarjit",American journal of physiology.

While the publication does not explicitly mention the smart mask, the underlying principles and methodologies are closely related, making it relevant to the grant's research objectives.","The publication abstract does not directly address the research objectives of the funding opportunity or the grant abstract.

The grant abstract, on the other hand, proposes the development of a 'smart mask' for surveillance of COVID-19, which is not directly related to the publication's topic. Therefore, the publication is not strongly related to the funding opportunity or the grant abstract, resulting in a score of 2 (Disagree)."

While the therapeutic arsenal has expanded significantly for management of relapsing forms of MS, treatment of individuals with progressive MS is suboptimal. This treatment inequality is in part due to an incomplete understanding of pathomechanisms at different stages of the disease-underscoring the critical need for new biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their bioactive cargo have emerged as endogenous nanoparticles with great theranostic potential-as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and ultimately as therapeutic candidates for precision nanotherapeutics.

Beginning from a template excised from the X-ray structure of the CTLA4:B7-2 complex, we generate several peptide sequences using flexible docking and modeling steps.

We hypothesise that a liberal oxygenation strategy during cardiac surgery leads to a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications than a restrictive oxygenation strategy. This study is a prospective, observer-blinded, centrally randomised and controlled, international multicentre clinical trial. After obtaining a written informed consent, 200 adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting will be enrolled and randomised to receive either restrictive or liberal oxygenation perioperatively. The liberal oxygenation group will receive 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen throughout the intraoperative period, including during cardiopulmonary bypass. The restrictive oxygenation group will receive the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain arterial partial pressure of oxygen between 100 and 150 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass and a pulse oximetry reading of 95% or greater intraoperatively, but no less than 0.3 and not higher than 0.80 (other than induction and when the oxygenation goals cannot be reached). When patients are transferred to the intensive care unit, all patients will receive an initial fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5, and then fraction of inspired oxygen will be titrated to maintain a pulse oximetry reading of 95% or greater until extubation. The lowest postoperative arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen within 48 hours of intensive care unit admission will be the primary outcome. Postoperative pulmonary complications, length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and 7-day mortality after cardiac surgery will be analysed as secondary outcomes.

To better understand viral dynamics in BEs, this study assesses viromes from 11 habitats across four types of BEs with low to high occupancy. The diversity, composition, metabolic functions, and lifestyles of the viromes are found to be habitat dependent. Caudoviricetes species are ubiquitous on surface habitats in the BEs, and some of them are distinct from those present in other environments. Antimicrobial resistance genes are identified in viruses inhabiting surfaces frequently touched by occupants and in viruses inhabiting occupants' skin.

PO<sub>2</sub>tox is a mission limiting factor for special operations forces divers using closed-circuit rebreathing apparatus and a potential side effect for patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. In this study, we aim to determine if there is a specific breath profile of compounds in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) that is indicative of the early stages of pulmonary hyperoxic stress/PO<sub>2</sub>tox. Using a double-blind, randomized 'sham' controlled, cross-over design 14 U.S. Navy trained diver volunteers breathed two different gas mixtures at an ambient pressure of 2 ATA (33 fsw, 10 msw) for 6.5 h. One test gas consisted of 100% O<sub>2</sub>(HBO) and the other was a gas mixture containing 30.6% O<sub>2</sub>with the balance N<sub>2</sub>(Nitrox). The high O<sub>2</sub>stress dive (HBO) and low O<sub>2</sub>stress dive (Nitrox) were separated by at least seven days and were conducted dry and at rest inside a hyperbaric chamber. EBC samples were taken immediately before and after each dive and subsequently underwent a targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Following the HBO dive, 10 out of 14 subjects reported symptoms of the early stages of PO<sub>2</sub>tox and one subject terminated the dive early due to severe symptoms of PO<sub>2</sub>tox. No symptoms of PO<sub>2</sub>tox were reported following the nitrox dive. A partial least-squares discriminant analysis of the normalized (relative to pre-dive) untargeted data gave good classification abilities between the HBO and nitrox EBC with an AUC of 0.99 (±2%) and sensitivity and specificity of 0.93 (±10%) and 0.94 (±10%), respectively. The resulting classifications identified specific biomarkers that included human metabolites and lipids and their derivatives from different metabolic pathways that may explain metabolomic changes resulting from prolonged HBO exposure.",Breath Tests|Cross-Over Studies|Humans|Hyperbaric Oxygenation|Hyperoxia|Nitrogen|Oxygen|breath analysis|metabolomics|oxygen toxicity|pulmonary hyperoxic stress,"Fothergill, David M|Borras, Eva|McCartney, Mitchell M|Schelegle, Edward S|Davis, Cristina E",Journal of breath research,"Journal Article|Randomized Controlled Trial|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",2023,TR003795,1U18TR003795-01,phs002600.v1.p1,RADx-rad,SCENT,2.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the metabolomics analysis of exhaled breath condensate in divers exposed to hyperbaric conditions, aiming to identify biomarkers for pulmonary oxygen toxicity.

Three separate experiments were set up to determine optimal conditions to collect eggs VOCs to discriminate male from female embryos. Optimal extraction time (2 min), storage conditions (short period of incubation during egg storage (SPIDES) at days 8-10 of incubation), and sampling temperature (37.5°C) were determined.

These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell-free nucleic acids (cf-NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all-in-one nanoscaffold-based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D-PHP) self-therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D-PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial-templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli-responsive drug release, disc-mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme-like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf-NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long-term pain reduction. Therefore, self-therapeutic and epigenetic modulator-encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.",2D nanomaterials|3D hybrid protein nanoscaffolds|Animals|Humans|Inflammation|Intervertebral Disc|Intervertebral Disc Degeneration|Oxidative Stress|Porins|Porosity|Rats|Reactive Oxygen Species|epigenetic modification|inflammation|intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration|nanoscaffolds|oxidative stress|self-assembly,"Yang, Letao|Bhujel, Basanta|Hou, Yannan|Luo, Jeffrey|An, Seong Bae|Han, Inbo|Lee, Ki-Bum","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",Journal Article,2023,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the development of a 3D porous hybrid protein nanoscaffold for treating intervertebral disc degeneration.

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin.

Genetic manipulations that delete or inactivate the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme confer protection against aortic stiffness induced by chronic ingestion of high-salt water (4%NaCl in drinking water for 3 weeks) or associated with aging. Therefore, there is heightened interest in identifying interventions capable of inhibiting translin/trax RNase activity, as these may have therapeutic efficacy in large-artery stiffness. Methods and Results Activation of neuronal adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>Rs) triggers dissociation of trax from its C-terminus. As A<sub>2A</sub>Rs are expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we investigated whether stimulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R on vascular smooth muscle cells promotes the association of translin with trax and, thereby increases translin/trax complex activity. We found that treatment of A7r5 cells with the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680 leads to increased association of trax with translin. Furthermore, this treatment decreases levels of pre-microRNA-181b, a target of translin/trax, and those of its downstream product, mature microRNA-181b. To check whether A<sub>2A</sub>R activation might contribute to high-salt water-induced aortic stiffening, we assessed the impact of daily treatment with the selective A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist SCH58261 in this paradigm. We found that this treatment blocked aortic stiffening induced by high-salt water. Further, we confirmed that the age-associated decline in aortic pre-microRNA-181b/microRNA-181b levels observed in mice also occurs in humans. Conclusions These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether blockade of A<sub>2A</sub>Rs may have therapeutic potential in treating large-artery stiffness.","Adenosine|Animals|Aorta|Carrier Proteins|DNA-Binding Proteins|Humans|Mice|MicroRNAs|Receptor, Adenosine A2A|Water|adenosine A2A receptor|microRNA|microRNA degradation|microRNA‐181b|translin/trax|vascular stiffness","Akiyoshi, Kei|Fujimori, Tomonari|Fu, Xiuping|Shah, Aparna P|Yamaguchi, Atsushi|Steenbergen, Charles|Santhanam, Lakshmi|Berkowitz, Dan|Tuday, Eric|Baraban, Jay M|Das, Samarjit",Journal of the American Heart Association,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,TR003780,1U18TR003780-01,phs003124.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the role of adenosine A2A receptors in regulating microRNA-181b expression and its implications for large-artery stiffness.

Unfortunately, conventional fluorescence microscopy has to make a trade-off between resolution and field of view due to the nature of the optics used to form an image. To overcome this barrier, we have developed an acoustofluidic scanning fluorescence nanoscope that can simultaneously achieve superior resolution, a large field of view, and enhanced fluorescent signal.

The causal bacterium, '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus', presents a sampling issue for qPCR diagnostics and results in a high false negative rate. In this work, we compared six metabolomics assays to identify HLB-infected citrus trees from leaf tissue extracted from 30 control and 30 HLB-infected trees. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based assay was most accurate. A final partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was trained and validated on 690 leaf samples with corresponding qPCR measures from three citrus varieties (Rio Red grapefruit, Hamlin sweet orange, and Valencia sweet orange) from orchards in Florida and Texas. Trees were naturally infected with HLB transmitted by the insect vector <i>Diaphorina citri</i>. In a randomized validation set, the assay was 99.9% accurate to classify diseased from nondiseased samples. This model was applied to samples from trees receiving plant defense-inducer compounds or biological treatments to prevent or cure HLB infection. From two trials, HLB-related metabolite abundances and PLS-DA scores were tracked longitudinally and compared with those of control trees.

Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in <i>X</i>/<i>Y</i> 2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10<sup>2</sup> copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes.

Due to a lack of effective antiviral therapies, there is a need to diagnose and surveil norovirus infections to implement quarantine protocols and prevent large outbreaks. Currently, the gold standard of diagnosis uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but PCR can have limited availability. Here, we propose a combination of a tunable peptide substrate and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to colorimetrically detect the Southampton norovirus 3C-like protease (SV3CP), a key protease in viral replication. Careful design of the substrate employs a zwitterionic peptide with opposite charged moieties on the C- and N- termini to induce a rapid color change visible to the naked eye; thus, this color change is indicative of SV3CP activity. This work expands on existing zwitterionic peptide strategies for protease detection by systematically evaluating the effects of lysine and arginine on nanoparticle charge screening. We also determine a limit of detection for SV3CP of 28.0 nM with comparable results in external breath condensate, urine, and fecal matter for 100 nM of SV3CP. The key advantage of this system is its simplicity and accessibility, thus making it an attractive tool for qualitative point-of-care diagnostics.",Caliciviridae Infections|Colorimetry|Endopeptidases|Feces|Gold|Humans|Metal Nanoparticles|Norovirus|Peptide Hydrolases|Peptides|Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,"Yeung, Justin|Jin, Zhicheng|Ling, Chuxuan|Retout, Maurice|Barbosa da Silva, Elany|Damani, Manan|Chang, Yu-Ci|Yim, Wonjun|O'Donoghue, Anthony J|Jokerst, Jesse V",The Analyst,Journal Article,2023,DE031114,1R01DE031114-01,phs002524.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance,2.5,"The publication abstract describes a method for detecting a norovirus protease using zwitterionic peptides and gold nanoparticles.

However, the potential application of anti-HER2 VHHs as a diagnostic tool suitable for ELISA, flow cytometry, cell imaging, bispecific antibody engineering, and immunohistochemistry has not been fully elucidated. To investigate this potential, HER2 antigen was expressed in HEK293 F cells, purified, and used to immunize llama. Using phage display, anti-HER2 VHHs with high affinity and specificity were isolated, sequenced, and constructed with a Histag and c-Myc tag. The constructed anti-HER2 VHHs were then expressed in E. coli, purified, and evaluated for their use in ELISA, flow cytometry, cell imaging, and immunohistochemistry. The affinities of the anti-HER2 VHHs toward the HER2 antigen were determined using biolayer interferometry. Furthermore, the binding sites of the anti-HER2 VHHs were evaluated by epitope mapping and in silico modeling and docking. Here, we report the sequence of an anti-HER2 VHH with high affinity (sub-nanomolar), specificity, and selectivity.

A common pitfall when utilizing AuNPs is their tendency to aggregate, especially when their surface is functionalized with ligands of low molecular weight (no steric repulsion) or ligands of neutral charge (no electrostatic repulsion). For biomedical applications, AuNPs that are colloidally stable are desirable because they have a high surface area and thus reactivity, resist sedimentation, and exhibit uniform optical properties. Here, we engineer the surface of AuNPs so that they remain stable when decorated with coiled-coil (CC) peptides while preserving the native polypeptide properties. We achieve this by using a neutral, mixed ligand layer composed of lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) and lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) maleimide to attach the CCs. Tuning the surface fraction of each component within the mixed ligand layer also allowed us to control the degree of AuNP labeling with CCs.

Existing approaches to estimating the time origins are commonly built on extrapolating a parametric longitudinal model, which rely on rigid assumptions that can lead to biased inferences. In this paper, we introduce a flexible semiparametric curve registration model. It assumes the longitudinal trajectories follow a flexible common shape function with person-specific disease progression pattern characterized by a random curve registration function, which is further used to model the unknown time origin as a random start time. This random time is used as a link to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data where the unknown time origins are integrated out in the joint likelihood function, which facilitates unbiased and consistent estimation. Since the disease progression pattern naturally predicts time-to-event, we further propose a new functional survival model using the registration function as a predictor of the time-to-event.

We studied rates of outpatient visits, new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) initiations, intra-articular glucocorticoid injections (iaGC), dispensed oral glucocorticoids and opioids, DMARD adherence, and DMARD discontinuation by quarter in March 2018-February 2021 (Q1 started in March). Incident rate ratios (IRR, pandemic vs prepandemic) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Poisson or Quasi-Poisson models stratified by diagnosis recency (incident JIA, <12 months ago; prevalent JIA, ≥12 months ago). Among 1294 children diagnosed with JIA, total and in-person outpatient visits for JIA declined during the pandemic (IRR, 0.88-0.90), most markedly in Q1 2020. Telemedicine visits, while higher during the pandemic, declined from 21% (Q1) to 13% (Q4) in 2020 to 2021. During the pandemic, children with prevalent JIA, but not incident JIA, had lower usage of iaGC (IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-1.07), oral glucocorticoids (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67), and opioids (IRR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.75). Adherence to and discontinuation of DMARDs was similar before and during the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, visits for JIA dropped by 10% to 12% in commercially insured children in the United States, declines partly mitigated by use of telemedicine. Pandemic-related declines in intra-articular glucocorticoids, oral glucocorticoids, and opioids were observed for children with prevalent, but not incident, JIA. These changes may have important implications for disease control and quality of life.","Antirheumatic Agents|Arthritis, Juvenile|COVID-19|Child|Glucocorticoids|Humans|Insurance|Pandemics|Quality of Life|Retrospective Studies","Horton, Daniel B|Yang, Yiling|Neikirk, Amanda|Huang, Cecilia|Crystal, Stephen|Davidow, Amy|Haynes, Kevin|Gerhard, Tobias|Rose, Carlos D|Strom, Brian L|Parlett, Lauren",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,Journal Article,2023,HD105619,1R61HD105619-01,phs002569.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,2.0,"The publication abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) using commercial insurance data.

While high peel-strength adhesives provide more secure skin attachment, they are difficult to remove from the skin and are correlated with medical adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears, and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to dressing or device dislodgement and further medical complications. This paper reports on the clinical testing of a new, high-adhesion medical tape, ThermoTape (University of Washington, US), designed for low skin trauma upon release. ThermoTape was benchmarked with Tegaderm (3M, US) and Kind Removal Tape (KRT) (3M, US). All three tapes were applied to both the left and right forearm of healthy volunteers and were removed 24 hours later-the right arm without applying heat and the left arm by applying a heat pack for 30 seconds before removal. Tape wear, self-reported pain (0-10 scale) and skin redness 15 minutes after removal were recorded. This was a 53-subject comparative, single-blind clinical trial. There were clinically and statistically significant results supporting reduced pain during removal of ThermoTape with warming, with an average 58% decrease in pain, paired with a statistically significant 45% reduction in skin redness (p<0.01 for both values). In contrast, there were statistically insignificant differences in pain and redness for removal of Tegaderm and KRT with warming. ThermoTape after warming, in comparison with Tegaderm without warming, produced a reduced pain score of >1 on the 0-10 Wong-Baker/Face pain scale, which was statistically significant (p<0.01). These results provide compelling evidence that warming ThermoTape prior to removal can reduce pain and injury when compared with standard medical tapes.

Adenosine (A)-to-Inosine (I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification, catalyzed by the ADAR family of enzymes, that can be considered part of the inherent cellular defense mechanism as it affects the innate immune response in a complex manner. It was previously reported that various viruses could interact with the host's ADAR enzymes, resulting in epigenetic changes both to the virus and the host. Here, we analyze RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swab specimens as well as whole-blood samples of COVID-19 infected individuals and show a significant elevation in the global RNA editing activity in COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. We also detect specific coding sites that exhibit higher editing activity.

The chronic stress leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. Roles of metals in these diseases, particularly PH are largely unknown. This review first discusses the pathophysiology of PH including vascular oxidative stress, inflammation, and remodeling in PH; mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic changes in PH; ion channel and its alterations in the pathogenesis of PH as well as PH-associated right ventricular (RV) remodeling and dysfunctions. This review then summarizes metal general features and essentiality for the cardiovascular system and effects of metals on systemic blood pressure. Lastly, this review explores non-essential and essential metals and potential roles of their dyshomeostasis in PH and RV dysfunction. Although it remains early to conclude the role of metals in the pathogenesis of PH, emerging direct and indirect evidence implicates the possible contributions of metal-mediated toxicities in the development of PH. Future research should focus on comprehensive clinical metallomics study in PH patients; mechanistic evaluations to elucidate roles of various metals in PH animal models; and novel therapy clinical trials targeting metals.

We used metagenomic sequencing, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, and culturing to profile the microbial and volatile chemical constituents of anal gland secretions in twenty-three domestic cats (Felis catus), in attempts to identify organisms potentially involved in host odor production. We found that the anal gland microbiome was dominated by bacteria in the genera Corynebacterium, Bacteroides, Proteus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus, and showed striking variation among individual cats. Microbiome profiles also varied with host age and obesity. Metabolites such as fatty-acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols were detected in glandular secretions. Overall, microbiome and metabolome profiles were modestly correlated (r = 0.17), indicating that a relationship exists between the bacteria in the gland and the metabolites produced in the gland.

The chronic and high-pressure stress experienced by endothelial cells can give rise to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. However, there is no clearly defined mechanism for PAH and available treatment options only provide limited symptomatic relief. Due to the far-reaching effects of metal exposures, the interaction between metals and the pulmonary vasculature is of particular interest. This review will briefly introduce the pathophysiology of PAH and then focus on the potential roles of metals, including essential and non-essential metals in the pathogenic process in the pulmonary arteries and right heart, which may be linked to PAH. Based on available data from human studies of occupational or environmental metal exposure, including lead, antimony, iron, and copper, the hypothesis of metals contributing to the pathogenesis of PAH is proposed as potential risk factors and underlying mechanisms for PAH. We propose that metals may initiate or exacerbate the pathogenesis of PAH, by providing potential mechanism by which metals interact with hypoxia-inducible factor and tumor suppressor p53 to modulate their downstream cellular proliferation pathways. These need further investigation.

Radiologist annotations of mucus plugs were incorporated in an image-processing pipeline to generate size and location information that was related to measures of airflow.RESULTSThe length distribution of 778 annotated mucus plugs was multimodal, and a 12 mm length defined short (""stubby"", ≤12 mm) and long (""stringy"", >12 mm) plug phenotypes. High mucus plug burden was disproportionately attributable to stringy mucus plugs. Mucus plugs localized predominantly to airway generations 6-9, and 47% of plugs in baseline scans persisted in the same airway for 3 years and fluctuated in length and volume. Mucus plugs in larger proximal generations had greater effects on spirometry measures than plugs in smaller distal generations, and a model of airflow that estimates the increased airway resistance attributable to plugs predicted a greater effect for proximal generations and more numerous mucus plugs.CONCLUSIONPersistent mucus plugs in proximal airway generations occur in asthma and demonstrate a stochastic process of formation and resolution over time.

Climate change is fueled by industrialization and the emission of greenhouse gases and leads to a range of effects, such as the redistribution of disease vectors, higher risks of disease transmission, and shifts in disease patterns. Rising temperatures pose risks to both food supplies and respiratory health. The hypothesis addressed is that environmental stressors including a spectrum of chemical and pathogen exposures as well as physical and psychological influences collectively impact genetics, metabolism, and cellular functions affecting physical and mental health. The objective is to report the mechanistic associations linking environment and health. As environmental stressors intensify, a surge in health conditions, spanning from allergies to neurodegenerative diseases, becomes evident; however, linkage to genetic-altered proteomics is more hidden. Investigations positing that environmental stressors cause mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress, which affect missense variants and neuro- and immuno-disorders, are reported. These disruptions to homeostasis with dyslipidemia and misfolded and aggregated proteins increase susceptibility to cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases. Proposed interventions, such as vitamin B supplements and antioxidants, target oxidative stress and may aid mitochondrial respiration and immune balance. The mechanistic interconnections of environmental stressors and disruptions in health need to be unraveled to develop strategies to protect public health.",Animals|Antioxidants|Autoimmune Diseases|Climate Change|Dietary Supplements|Disease Vectors|Humans|autoimmune disease|chaperones|folate|metabolites|mitochondria|oxidative stress,"Heidari, Hajar|Lawrence, David A",International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article|Review,2023,HD105613,1R61HD105613-01,phs002609.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,1.5,"The publication abstract discusses the relationship between environmental stressors and various health conditions, focusing on mechanisms like mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

A Critical Review.,"The decision to perform biventricular repair (BVR) in neonates and infants presenting with either single or multiple left ventricle outflow obstructions (LVOTOs) and a borderline left ventricle (BLV) is subject to extensive discussion, and limited information is known regarding the long-term outcomes. As a result, the objective of this study is to critically assess and summarize the available data regarding the prognosis of neonates and infants with LVOTO and BLV who underwent BVR. In February 2023, we conducted a review study with three different medical search engines (the National Library of Medicine, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library) for Medical Subject Headings and free text terms including ""congenital heart disease"", ""outcome"", and ""borderline left ventricle"". The search was refined by adding keywords for ""Shone's complex"", ""complex LVOT obstruction"", ""hypoplastic left heart syndrome/complex"", and ""critical aortic stenosis"". Out of a total of 51 studies, 15 studies were included in the final analysis. The authors utilized heterogeneous definitions to characterize BLV, resulting in considerable variation in inclusion criteria among studies. Three distinct categories of studies were identified, encompassing those specifically designed to evaluate BLV, those focused on Shone's complex, and finally those on aortic stenosis. Despite the challenges associated with comparing data originating from slightly different cardiac defects and from different eras, our results indicate a favorable survival rate and clinical outcome following BVR. However, the incidence of reintervention remains high, and concerns persist regarding residual pulmonary hypertension, which has been inadequately investigated. The available data concerning neonates and infants with LVOTO and BLV who undergo BVR are inadequate and fragmented.

While regeneration within the central nervous system is minimal, peripheral nerves can regenerate, albeit with limitations. The regenerative mechanisms of the peripheral nervous system thus provide fertile ground for clinical and scientific advancement, and opportunities to learn fundamental lessons regarding nerve behavior in the context of regeneration, particularly the relationship of axons to their support cells and the extracellular matrix environment. However, few current interventions adequately address peripheral nerve injuries. This article aims to elucidate areas in which progress might be made toward developing better interventions, particularly using synthetic nerve grafts. The article first provides a thorough review of peripheral nerve anatomy, physiology, and the regenerative mechanisms that occur in response to injury. This is followed by a discussion of currently available interventions for peripheral nerve injuries. Promising biomaterial fabrication techniques which aim to recapitulate nerve architecture, along with approaches to enhancing these biomaterial scaffolds with growth factors and cellular components, are then described.

However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis-resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR-Ms can transmigrate within a mico-fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment. The developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next-generation cardiovascular disease therapies and further studies include in vivo experiments.","Animals|Apoptosis|CAR macrophage|CD47 Antigen|Efferocytosis|Humans|Liposomes|Liver X Receptors|Macrophages|Mice|Nanoparticles|Reactive Oxygen Species|Receptors, Chimeric Antigen|Signal Transduction|atherosclerosis|efferocytosis|lipid nanoparticle|β‐cyclodextrin","Chuang, Skylar T|Stein, Joshua B|Nevins, Sarah|Kilic Bektas, Cemile|Choi, Hye Kyu|Ko, Wan-Kyu|Jang, Hyunjun|Ha, Jihun|Lee, Ki-Bum","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",Journal Article,2024,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on enhancing CAR macrophage efferocytosis using lipid nanoparticles targeting LXR signaling, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing a breathalyzer for COVID-19 detection.

Unlike depot formulations, slowly releasing drug at the injection site into the blood, DcNP allows multiple-drug-in-combination to collectively distribute from the injection site into the lymphatic system. Two distinct classes of long-acting injectables products are proposed based on pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Class I involves sustained release at the injection site. Class II involves a drug-carrier complex composed of lopinavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir uptake and retention in the lymphatic system before systemic access as a part of the PBPK model validation. For clinical development, Class II long-acting drug-combination products, we leverage data from 3 nonhuman primate studies consisting of nine PK datasets: Study 1, varying fixed-dose ratios; Study 2, short multiple dosing with kinetic tails; Study 3, long multiple dosing (chronic). PBPK validation criteria were established to validate each scenario for all drugs. The models passed validation in 8 of 9 cases, specifically to predict Study 1 and 2, including PK tails, with ritonavir and tenofovir, fully passing Study 3 as well. PBPK model for lopinavir in Study 3 did not pass the validation due to an observable time-varying and delayed drug accumulation, which likely was due to ritonavir's CYP3A inhibitory effect building up during multiple dosing that triggered a mechanism-based drug-drug interaction (DDI).

The BiKE:E5C1 exhibits high affinity/specificity for the CD16a activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on cancer cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BiKE:E5C1 can activate the NK cells and induce the killing of HER2+ ovarian and breast cancer cells, surpassing the performance of the best-in-class monoclonal antibody, Trazimera (trastuzumab). To advance this BiKE technology toward clinical application, the objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of BiKE:E5C1 to activate CD16+ immune cells such as NK cells and macrophages to kill cancer cells, and eradicate metastatic HER2+ tumors in NK humanized NOG mice. We assessed BiKE:E5C1's potential to activate CD16-expressing peripheral blood (PB)-NK cells, laNK92 cells, and THP-1-CD16A monocyte-macrophages through flowcytometry and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC) assays. Subsequently, laNK92 cells were selected as effector cells and genetically modified to express the nanoluciferase gene, enabling the monitoring of their viability in NK humanized NOG mice using quantitative bioluminescent imaging (qBLI). To evaluate the functionality of BiKE:E5C1 in vivo, we introduced firefly luciferase-expressing ovarian cancer cells via intraperitoneal injection into hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mice, creating a model of ovarian cancer metastasis. Once tumor establishment was confirmed, we treated the mice with laNK92 cells plus BiKE:E5C1 and the response to therapy was assessed using qBLI. Our data demonstrate that BiKE:E5C1 activates not only laNK92 cells but also PB-NK cells and macrophages, significantly enhancing their anticancer activities. ADCC assay demonstrated that IgG<sub>1</sub> Fc region had no impact on BiKE:E5C1's anticancer activity. In vivo results reveal that both hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mouse models support the viability and proliferation of laNK92 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that BiKE:E5C1 activates laNK92 cells in mice, leading to eradication of cancer metastasis in both NK humanized hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mouse models. Collectively, our in vivo findings underscore BiKE:E5C1's potential as an immune cell engager capable of activating immune cells for cancer cell elimination, thereby expanding the arsenal of available BiKEs for cancer immunotherapy.","Animals|Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity|Female|Humans|Killer Cells, Natural|Macrophages|Mice|Ovarian Neoplasms|Trastuzumab|antibodies, bispecific|cytotoxicity, immunologic","Khoshtinat Nikkhoi, Shahryar|Yang, Ge|Owji, Hajar|Grizotte-Lake, Mayara|Cohen, Rick I|Gil Gonzalez, Lazaro|Massumi, Mohammad|Hatefi, Arash",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,Journal Article,2024,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the development of a bispecific immune cell engager (BiKE:E5C1) for cancer immunotherapy, specifically targeting HER2+ cancer cells.

Prostate cancer tumors display highly glycolytic phenotypes as the cancer progresses. Nonspecific inhibitors of glycolysis have not been utilized successfully for chemotherapy, because of their penchant to cause systemic toxicity. This study reports the preclinical activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a novel small-molecule preclinical candidate, BKIDC-1553, with antiglycolytic activity. We tested a large battery of prostate cancer cell lines for inhibition of cell proliferation, in vitro. Cell-cycle, metabolic, and enzymatic assays were used to demonstrate their mechanism of action. A human patient-derived xenograft model implanted in mice and a human organoid were studied for sensitivity to our BKIDC preclinical candidate. A battery of pharmacokinetic experiments, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion experiments, and in vitro and in vivo toxicology experiments were carried out to assess readiness for clinical trials. We demonstrate a new class of small-molecule inhibitors where antiglycolytic activity in prostate cancer cell lines is mediated through inhibition of hexokinase 2. These compounds display selective growth inhibition across multiple prostate cancer models. We describe a lead BKIDC-1553 that demonstrates promising activity in a preclinical xenograft model of advanced prostate cancer, equivalent to that of enzalutamide. BKIDC-1553 demonstrates safety and pharmacologic properties consistent with a compound that can be taken into human studies with expectations of a good safety margin and predicted dosing for efficacy.

Hydrogel materials have gained significant attention for burn wound treatment in clinical practice among various advanced dressings due to their soothing and moisturizing activity. However, prolonged healing, pain, and traumatic removal due to the lack of long-term wound hydration are some of the challenges in the treatment of second-degree burn wounds. In this study, 3D-printed dressings were fabricated using gelatin, alginate, and bioactive borate glass (BBG) using an extrusion-based bioprinter. After ionic crosslinking, the 3D-printed dressings were characterized for mechanical properties, degradation rate, hydration activity, and <i>in vitro</i> cell viability using human fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that in 3D-printed dressings with 20 wt% BBG, Young's modulus increased by 105%, and 10-day degradation rate decreased by 62%. Addition of BBG prevented the burst release of water from hydrogel dressings and enabled the continuous water release for up to 10 days, which is crucial in treating second-degree burn wounds. 3D-printed hydrogel dressings with BBG showed long-term cell viability that can be a result of the accumulative release of therapeutic ions from BBG particulate. The <i>in vivo</i> wound healing functionality of the dressings was investigated using a rat model with a second-degree burn wound. Our animal study showed that the 3D-printed dressings with BBG exhibited faster wound closure, non-adhesive contact, non-invasive debridement, and non-traumatic dressing removal. Histological analysis suggested that 3D-printed dressings contributed to more uniform re-epithelialization and tissue remodeling compared to the non-printed hydrogels of the same compositions. Critically, 3D-printed dressings with BBG led to significant regeneration of hair follicles compared to the 3D-printed hydrogel, non-printed hydrogel, and the control groups.

A historical review of TAHs is also presented to aid in benchmarking performance metrics. Six TAHs, ranging from spooky Halloween beating hearts to a cute colorful plush heart, were imaged, instrumented (mock flow loops) to measure their pressure, volume, and flow, and qualitatively evaluated by 3rd party cardiac surgeons for anatomical accuracy and surgical considerations. Imaging of Claw, Beating, and Frankenstein TAHs revealed internal motors, circuit boards, and speakers. Gummy TAH was ranked favorite TAH for tactile realism, while Frankenstein TAH had the most favorable audible/visual indicators, including an illuminated Jacob's Ladder. Beating TAH demonstrated superior pulsatile hemodynamic performance compared to Claw TAH (16mL vs 1.3mL stroke volume). Light Up TAH and Gummy TAH functioned only as passive compliance chambers. Cute TAH rapidly exsanguinated due to its porosity (-3.0 L/min flow). These TAHs demonstrated a wide range of anatomical accuracy, surgeon appeal, unique features, and hemodynamic performance. While Claw TAH and Beating TAH successfully generated a modicum of pulsatility, we recommend the clinical community continue to support pre-clinical development of emerging or use of clinically-approved TAHs.","Heart, Artificial|Hemodynamics|Humans","Monreal, Gretel|Koenig, Steven C|Huang, Jiapeng|Slaughter, Mark S",ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2024,TR003787,1U18TR003787-01,phs002563.v1.p1,RADx-rad,SCENT,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses the characterization of total artificial hearts (TAHs), focusing on their anatomy, function, and performance metrics.

A secondary analysis used linear regression to assess study enrollments two days before and after a social media post, adjusted for the statewide pediatric seven-day-average severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case rate, social media posting day, and the interaction of these two variables. Results In seven months before social media posting, only eight patients were enrolled. One week after social media posting began, the median weekly enrollment increased (0 to 3). In the regression model, neither social media post day nor the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 case rate was significantly associated with enrollment rate. However, the interaction of a post day and the pediatric case rate was significant.

Following COVID-19 infection, abnormalities on pulmonary function tests (PFT) are common. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate for any correlation between PFT abnormalities and impairment in HRQoL scores following COVID-19 infection. This is an analysis of a prospective cohort of patients in Louisville, KY who were infected with COVID-19. Data collected included demographics, past medical history, laboratory tests, PFTs, and several HRQoL questionnaires such as the EuroQol 5 Dimension HRQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Descriptive statistics were performed, comparing PFTs (normal vs abnormal) and time since COVID-19 infection (3- vs 6- vs ≥ 12 months). There were no significant differences in FEV1, FVC, or the percentage of patients with abnormal PFTs over time after COVID-19 infection. Following COVID-19, patients with normal PFTs had worse impairment in mobility HRQoL scores and change in GAD-7 scores over time. There were no differences over time in any of the HRQoL scores among patients with abnormal PFTs. Among patients with an abnormal PFT, there was no temporal association with HRQoL scores as measured by EQ-5D-5 L, GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PCL-5.

However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications.

The pre-metastatic niche (PMN) is a tissue microenvironment that has undergone changes to support the colonization and growth of circulating tumor cells, a key component of which is the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC). Therefore, the MDSC has been identified as a potential biomarker for PMN formation, the detection of which would enable clinicians to proactively treat metastases. However, there is currently no technology capable of the in situ detection of MDSCs available in the clinic. Here, we propose the use of shortwave infrared-emitting nanoprobes for the tracking of MDSCs and identification of the PMN. Our rare-earth albumin nanocomposites (ReANCs) are engineered to bind the Gr-1 surface marker of murine MDSCs. When delivered intravenously in murine models of breast cancer with high rates of metastasis, the targeted ReANCs demonstrated an increase in localization to the lungs in comparison to control ReANCs. However, no difference was seen in the model with slower rates of metastasis. This highlights the potential utility of MDSC-targeted nanoprobes to assess PMN development and prognosticate disease progression.",myeloid-derived suppressor cells|pre-metastatic niche|prognostication|rare-earth nanoprobes|shortwave infrared imaging,"Siebert, Jake N|Shah, Jay V|Tan, Mei Chee|Riman, Richard E|Pierce, Mark C|Lattime, Edmund C|Ganapathy, Vidya|Moghe, Prabhas V",Pharmaceutics,Journal Article,2024,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the detection of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the lung pre-metastatic niche using shortwave infrared nanoprobes.

Here we investigate the molecular role and clinical significance of intelectin-1 (ITLN-1) in the development of pathologic airway mucus in asthma. Through analyses of human airway epithelial cells we find that ITLN1 gene expression is highly induced by interleukin-13 (IL-13) in a subset of metaplastic MUC5AC<sup>+</sup> mucus secretory cells, and that ITLN-1 protein is a secreted component of IL-13-induced mucus. Additionally, we find ITLN-1 protein binds the C-terminus of the MUC5AC mucin and that its deletion in airway epithelial cells partially reverses IL-13-induced mucostasis. Through analysis of nasal airway epithelial brushings, we find that ITLN1 is highly expressed in T2-high asthmatics, when compared to T2-low children. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both ITLN-1 gene expression and protein levels are significantly reduced by a common genetic variant that is associated with protection from the formation of mucus plugs in T2-high asthma.

In this study, a novel miR-133a zipper nanoparticle (NP) system that integrates miRNA zipper technology with rolling circle transcription (RCT) to achieve targeted delivery and specific regulation of miR-133a in adipocytes, is presented. This innovative approach can greatly enhance the delivery and release of miR-133a zippers, increasing the expression of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial biogenesis. he miR-133a zipper NP is utilized for the delivery of miRNA zipper-blocking miR-133a, an endogenous inhibitor of Prdm16 expression, to enhance the thermogenic activity of adipocytes by modulating their transcriptional program. Inhibition of miR-133a through the miR-133a zipper NP leads to more significant upregulation of thermogenic gene expression (Prdm16 and Ucp1) than with the free miR-133a zipper strand.

In this study, we used baseline olfactory identification measures with longitudinal flortaucipir and PiB PET, diffusion MRI of 89 cognitively normal older adults (73.82 ± 8.44 years; 56% females), and a transcriptomic data atlas to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading and genetic vulnerabilities of AD-related pathology aggregates in the olfactory system. We find that odor identification deficits are predominantly associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with a particularly strong predictive power for longitudinal tau progression. We observe that tau spreads from the medial temporal lobe structures toward the olfactory system, not the reverse. Moreover, we observed a genetic background of odor perception-related genes that might confer vulnerability to tau accumulation along the olfactory system.","Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Aging|Alzheimer Disease|Brain|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Olfactory Pathways|Olfactory Perception|Positron-Emission Tomography|Smell|Temporal Lobe|tau Proteins","Diez, Ibai|Ortiz-Terán, Laura|Ng, Thomas S C|Albers, Mark W|Marshall, Gad|Orwig, William|Kim, Chan-Mi|Bueichekú, Elisenda|Montal, Victor|Olofsson, Jonas|Vannini, Patrizia|El Fahkri, Georges|Sperling, Reisa|Johnson, Keith|Jacobs, Heidi I L|Sepulcre, Jorge",Nature communications,Journal Article,2024,DC019579,4U01DC019579-03,phs002964.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,2.0,"The publication abstract discusses tau propagation in the brain's olfactory circuits and its association with smell perception changes in aging, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease.

Because of antigenic drift, influenza vaccines are frequently updated, though their efficacy may still be limited due to strain mismatches. Despite the high levels of viral diversity observed across populations, most human studies reveal limited intrahost diversity, leaving the origin of population-level viral diversity unclear. Previous studies show host characteristics, such as immunity, might affect within-host viral evolution. Here we investigate influenza A viral diversity in children aged between 6 months and 18 years. Influenza virus evolution in children is less well characterized than in adults, yet may be associated with higher levels of viral diversity given the lower level of pre-existing immunity and longer durations of infection in children. We obtained influenza isolates from banked influenza A-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the 2017-18 influenza season. Using next-generation sequencing, we evaluated the population of influenza viruses present in each sample. We characterized within-host viral diversity using the number and frequency of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) detected in each sample. We related viral diversity to clinical metadata, including subjects' age, vaccination status, and comorbid conditions, as well as sample metadata such as virus strain and cycle threshold. Consistent with previous studies, most samples contained low levels of diversity with no clear association between the subjects' age, vaccine status, or health status. Further, there was no enrichment of iSNVs near known antigenic sites.

Plaque buildup results in the constriction of arteries, causing a shortage of blood supply to tissues and organs. Removing atherosclerotic plaques controls the development of acute ischemic stroke and heart diseases. It remains imperative for positive patient outcomes. This study sought to develop a minimally invasive technique for removing arterial plaques by applying focused ultrasound (FUS) energy on the metal surface of a nitinol catheter wire to induce inertial cavitation. The induced cavitation can deplete plaque mechanically inside the arteries, leading towards improved recanalization of blood vessels. The enhanced cavitation effect induced by combining FUS with a metal catheter was first verified by exposing agar phantom gels with or without a 0.9-mm diameter nitinol wire to an acoustic field produced by a 0.5-MHz FUS transducer. The phenomenon was further confirmed in pork belly fat samples with or without a 3-mm diameter nitinol catheter wire. Cavitation was monitored by detecting the peaks of emitted ultrasound signals from the samples using a passive cavitation detector (PCD). Cavitation threshold values were determined by observing the jump in the peak amplitude of signals received by the PCD when the applied FUS peak negative pressure (PNP) increased. To simulate arterial plaque removal, FUS with or without a catheter was used to remove tissues from pork belly fat samples and the lipid cores of human atherosclerotic plaque samples using 2500-cycle FUS bursts at 10% duty cycle and a burst repetition rate of 20 Hz. Treatment outcomes were quantified by subtracting the weight of samples before treatment from the weight of samples after treatment. All measurements were repeated 5 times (n = 5) unless otherwise indicated, and paired t-tests were used to compare the means of two groups. A p-value of <0.05 will be considered significant. Our results showed that with a nitinol wire, the cavitation threshold in agar phantoms was reduced to 2.6 MPa from 4.3 MPa PNP when there was no nitinol wire in the focal region of FUS. For pork belly fat samples, cavitation threshold values were 1.0 and 2.0 MPa PNP, with and without a catheter wire, respectively. Pork belly fat tissues and lipid cores of atherosclerotic plaques were depleted at the interface between a catheter and the samples at 2 and 4 MPa FUS PNP, respectively. The results showed that with a catheter wire in the focal region of a 3-min FUS treatment session, 24.7 and 25.6 mg of lipid tissues were removed from pork belly fat and human atherosclerotic samples, respectively. In contrast, the FUS-only group showed no reduction in sample weight. The differences between FUS-only and FUS-plus-catheter groups were statistically significant (p < 0.001 for the treatment on pork belly samples, and p < 0.01 for the treatment on human atherosclerotic samples). This study demonstrated the feasibility of catheter-assisted FUS therapy for removing atherosclerotic plaques.","Animals|Catheters|High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation|Humans|Phantoms, Imaging|Plaque, Atherosclerotic|Swine|atherosclerosis|catheter|cavitation|focused ultrasound","Samaddar, Abhirup|Singh, Rohit|Yang, Xinmai|Ebersole, Koji C|Forrest, M Laird",Medical physics,Journal Article,2024,HL152410,1U01HL152410-01,phs002522.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the use of catheter-assisted pulsed focused ultrasound ablation for removing atherosclerotic plaques, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that are centered on developing biosensing technologies for COVID-19 detection.

Mitochondrial translocation of miR-181c in cardiomyocytes results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during obesity. ROS causes Sp1, a transcription factor for MICU1, to be degraded via post-translational modification. The subsequent decrease in MICU1 expression causes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, ultimately leading to a propensity for heart failure. Herein, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Ser 387 (in human) or Ser 388 (in mouse) inhibits the translocation of miR-181c into the mitochondria by increasing the cytoplasmic stability of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Initially, estrogen offers cardioprotection in pre-menopausal females against the consequences of mitochondrial miR-181c upregulation by driving the phosphorylation of AGO2. Neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes (NMVM) treated with insulin showed an increase in pAGO2 levels and a decrease in mitochondrial miR-181c expression by increasing the binding affinity of AGO2-GW182 in the RISC. Thus, insulin treatment prevented excessive ROS production and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. In human cardiomyocytes, we overexpressed miR-181c to mimic pathological conditions, such as obesity/diabetes. Treatment with estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) for 48 h significantly lowered miR-181c entry into the mitochondria through increased pAGO2 levels. E<sub>2</sub> treatment also normalized Sp1 degradation and MICU1 transcription that normally occurs in response to miR-181c overexpression. We then investigated these findings using an in vivo model, with age-matched male, female and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Consistent with the E<sub>2</sub> treatment, we show that female hearts express higher levels of pAGO2 and thus, exhibit higher association of AGO2-GW182 in cytoplasmic RISC. This results in lower expression of mitochondrial miR-181c in female hearts compared to male or OVX groups. Further, female hearts had fewer consequences of mitochondrial miR-181c expression, such as lower Sp1 degradation and significantly decreased MICU1 transcriptional regulation. Taken together, this study highlights a potential therapeutic target for conditions such as obesity and diabetes, where miR-181c is upregulated. NEW AND NOTEWORTHY: In this study, we show that the phosphorylation of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) stabilizes the RNA-induced silencing complex in the cytoplasm, preventing miR-181c entry into the mitochondria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment with estradiol can inhibit the translocation of miR-181c into the mitochondria by phosphorylating AGO2. This ultimately eliminates the downstream consequences of miR-181c overexpression by mitigating excessive reactive oxygen species production and calcium entry into the mitochondria.","Animals|Argonaute Proteins|Calcium|Calcium-Binding Proteins|Cation Transport Proteins|Female|Gender differences|Heart|Humans|Insulin|Male|Mice|MicroRNAs|Mitochondria|Mitochondria, Heart|Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins|Mitochondrial microRNA|Myocytes, Cardiac|Obesity|Phosphorylation|RNA-Induced Silencing Complex|Reactive Oxygen Species|Sex Characteristics|Sp1 Transcription Factor|miR-181c","Quiroga, Diego|Roman, Barbara|Salih, Marwan|Daccarett-Bojanini, William N|Garbus, Haley|Ebenebe, Obialunanma V|Dodd-O, Jeffrey M|O'Rourke, Brian|Kohr, Mark|Das, Samarjit",Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,Journal Article,2024,TR003780,1U18TR003780-01,phs003124.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the phosphorylation of Argonaute 2 and its role in cardioprotection, particularly in females.

The aim of this study was to compare wastewater detection of xylazine with other public health and safety surveillance data from 2019 to 2023 in Kentucky. Wastewater samples from 5 rest areas, 2 truck weigh stations, and 4 wastewater treatment plants were tested for xylazine. Wastewater xylazine positivity rates were compared with xylazine-positive submission rates from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System and Kentucky's fatal overdoses in 6-month periods (Period 1=January-June; Period 2=July-December). Xylazine was detected in 61.6% (424 of 688) of daily wastewater samples from roadway sites/wastewater treatment plants. For roadways, detection increased from 55% (Period 1, 2021) to 94% (Period 1, 2023), and wastewater treatment plants had an overall detection of 25.8% (<i>n</i>=66 samples, Periods 1 and 2, 2022). Increasing roadway positivity corresponded to trends in National Forensic Laboratory Information System xylazine-positive submission rates: from 0.19 per 1,000 submissions (Period 1, 2019) to 2.9 per 1,000 (Period 2, 2022, latest available).

The ability to control and investigated macrophage inflammatory responses at the implant-macrophage interface would be critical for reducing chronic inflammation and improving tissue integration. Nonetheless, the systematic investigation of how surface topography affects macrophage polarization is typically complicated by the restricted complexity of accessible nanostructures, difficulties in achieving exact control, and biased preselection of experimental parameters. In response to these problems, we developed a large-scale, high-content combinatorial biophysical cue (CBC) array for enabling high-throughput screening (HTS) of the effects of nanotopography on macrophage polarization and subsequent inflammatory processes. Our CBC array, created utilizing the dynamic laser interference lithography (DLIL) technology, contains over 1 million nanotopographies, ranging from nanolines and nanogrids to intricate hierarchical structures with dimensions ranging from 100 nm to several microns. Using machine learning (ML) based on the Gaussian process regression algorithm, we successfully identified certain topographical signals that either repress (pro-M2) or stimulate (pro-M1) macrophage polarization. The upscaling of these nanotopographies for further examination has shown mechanisms such as cytoskeletal remodeling and ROCK-dependent epigenetic activation to be critical to the mechanotransduction pathways regulating macrophage fate. Thus, we have also developed a platform combining advanced DLIL nanofabrication techniques, HTS, ML-driven prediction of nanobio interactions, and mechanotransduction pathway evaluation.

Indocyanine green (ICG) assisted near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dental imaging technique can solve this problem due to the deep penetration of NIR light and the excellent fluorescence characteristics of ICG. This study extracted 593 human cracked tooth images and 601 non-cracked tooth images from NIR imaging videos. Multiple imaging analysis methods such as classification, object detection, and super-resolution were applied to the dataset for cracked image analysis. Our results showed that machine learning methods could help analyze tooth crack efficiently: the tooth images with cracks and without cracks could be well classified with the pre-trained residual network and squeezenet1_1 models, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% and 94.25%, respectively; the single shot multi-box detector (SSD) was able to recognize cracks, even if the input image was at a different size from the original cracked image; the super-resolution (SR) model, SR-generative adversarial network demonstrated enhanced resolution of crack images using high-resolution concrete crack images as the training dataset. Overall, deep learning model-assisted human crack analysis improves crack identification; the combination of our NIR dental imaging system and deep learning models has the potential to assist dentists in crack diagnosis.","Crack detection|Deep Learning|Deep learning|Human tooth cracks diagnosis|Humans|Image Processing, Computer-Assisted|Indocyanine Green|NIRF dental imaging|Tooth|Tooth Fractures","Li, Zheng|Li, Zhongqiang|Zhang, Ya|Wang, Huaizhi|Li, Xin|Zhang, Jian|Zaid, Waleed|Yao, Shaomian|Xu, Jian",Annals of biomedical engineering,Journal Article,2025,AA029348,1U01AA029348-01,phs002573.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the analysis of human tooth cracks using deep learning techniques, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that aim to develop a system for detecting and tracing SARS-CoV-2.

In cancer, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) happens which results in lipid peroxidation with a major product of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Adduction by HNE causes alteration to the structure of proteins, leading to loss of function. Blebbing of EVs carrying these HNE-adducted proteins as a cargo or carrying HNE-adducted on EV membrane are methods for clearing these molecules by the cells. We have referred to these EVs as Redox EVs. Here, we utilize a surface tension-mediated extraction process, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), for the rapid and efficient isolation of intact Redox EVs, from a mixed population of EVs derived from human glioblastoma cell line LN18. After optimizing different parameters, two populations of EVs were analyzed, those isolated from the sample (Redox EVs) and those remaining in the original sample (Remaining EVs). Electron microscopic imaging was used to confirm the presence of HNE adducts on the outer leaflet of Redox EVs. Moreover, the population of HNE-adducted Redox EVs shows significantly different characteristics to those of Remaining EVs including smaller size EVs and a more negative zeta potential EVs. We further treated glioblastoma cells (LN18), radiation-resistant glioblastoma cells (RR-LN18), and normal human astrocytes (NHA) with both Remaining and Redox EV populations. Our results indicate that Redox EVs promote the growth of glioblastoma cells, likely through the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and cause injury to normal astrocytes. In contrast, Remaining EVs have minimal impact on the viability of both glioblastoma cells and NHA cells. Thus, isolating a subpopulation of EVs employing ESP-based immunoaffinity could pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of how subtypes of EVs, such as those containing HNE-adducted proteins, induce biological changes in the cells that take up these EVs.","4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE)|Aldehydes|Cell Line, Tumor|EV isolation|EV purification|Extracellular Vesicles|Extracellular vesicles|Glioblastoma|Humans|Immunoaffinity|Oxidation-Reduction|Redox EVs","Banadaki, Mohammad Dehghan|Rummel, Nicole G|Backus, Spencer|Butterfield, David Allan|St Clair, Daret K|Campbell, James M|Zhong, Weixiong|Mayer, Kristy|Berry, Scott M|Chaiswing, Luksana",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,Journal Article,2024,DA053903,1U01DA053903-01,phs002542.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,2.0,"The publication abstract focuses on the extraction of redox extracellular vesicles using exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), which is a technique mentioned in the grant abstract.

Curve registration can be used to remove this variability, but determining the appropriate level of warping flexibility can be complicated. Curve registration also requires a target to which a functional object is aligned, typically the cross-sectional mean of functional objects within the same cluster. However, this mean is unknown prior to clustering. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between flexible warping and the number of resulting clusters. Removing more phase variability through curve registration can lead to fewer remaining variations in the functional data, resulting in a smaller number of clusters. Thus, the optimal number of clusters and warping flexibility cannot be uniquely identified. We propose to use external information to solve the identification issue. We define a cross validated Kullback-Leibler information criterion to select the number of clusters and the warping penalty. The criterion is derived from the predictive classification likelihood considering the joint distribution of both the functional data and external variable and penalizes the uncertainty in the cluster membership. We evaluate our method through simulation and apply it to electrocardiographic data collected in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study.

Our novel microfabrication process and custom-built signal conditioning hardware provides the advantage of providing accurate features and steady signals. The fabrication process relies on standard microfabrication techniques (i.e., deposition, photolithography, and wet etching). This fabrication method involves the novel application of two layers of positive and negative photoresists in addition to Parafilm<sup>®</sup> wax tape. Open edge and tiered depth details were successfully created from a multilayer planar mask. This is a benefit for integrated miniaturized and microfluidic systems that often require micro features for their functionality but relatively large millimeter size features for their physical periphery. We demonstrate the fundamental performance of electrospray with this microfluidic chip. The emitter tip was fixed on a linear axis stage with high resolution (10 μm) to finely control the tip distance from a metal counter electrode plate. A custom printed circuit board system was built to safely control four voltages applied to the microchip ports from a single high voltage power supply. To readily form the electrospray, non-aqueous solvents were used for their low viscosity and a constant voltage of +2.7 kV was applied to the sheath electrospray microchannel. The liquid being sprayed was 80/20 (v/v) methanol/acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid in the sheath microchannel and with ammonium acetate (10-40 mM) in its remaining microchannels. The electrospray signal was measured in response to varying the distance (1.4 to 1.6 mm) between the electrospray emitter tip and a metal counter electrode plate in addition to the varying concentration of the background electrolyte, ammonium acetate. Stable and repeatable electrospray signal showed linear relationships with emitter tip distance and concentration (r<sup>2</sup>≥0.95).",electrospray ionization|electrospray stability|glass etching|glass microfabrication|microfluidics|miniaturization,"Schmidt, Alexander J|Zamuruyev, Konstantin O|LeVasseur, Michael K|Fung, Stephanie|Anishchenko, Ilya M|Kenyon, Nicholas J|Davis, Cristina E",Microelectronic engineering,Journal Article,2023,TR003795,1U18TR003795-01,phs002600.v1.p1,RADx-rad,SCENT,2.5,"The publication abstract describes the development of a microfabricated glass chip for electrospray ionization, which is a component used in analytical systems.

The current means to pharmacologically treat excessive uncontrolled lung inflammation needs improvement because many treatments are or will become immunosuppressive.

This response brings phagocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue site to phagocytize and neutralize bacterial invaders and enables airway antimicrobial functions. This physiologic response is ideally self-limited with initiation and resolution phases. Polyunsaturated essential fatty acids are precursors to potent molecules that govern both phases. In the initiation phase, arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandins and leukotrienes that activate leukocytes to transmigrate from postcapillary venules.

Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",Cell-based biosensor|Conditional protein splicing|Hippocalcin|Neural stem cell engineering|Neuronal differentiation|Non-invasive monitoring|Real-time monitoring|Split-intein,"Lee, Euiyeon|Choi, Hye Kyu|Kwon, Youngeun|Lee, Ki-Bum",Advanced functional materials,Journal Article,2024,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the development of a biosensor for monitoring neuronal differentiation in stem cells, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that are centered on COVID-19 diagnostic technologies.

In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of this system in developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. This process is believed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which the neurovascular system interacts with the brain and how it can be targeted for therapeutic purposes, this area of research holds great promise for the future of neurology and medicine. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials.

In this study, we explored the engineering of a tetravalent BiKE by fusing two anti-CD16a and two anti-HER2 VHHs in tandem, using bivalent BiKE as a template. The tetravalent BiKE was genetically engineered, and its tertiary structure was predicted using in silico modeling. The antigen binding and affinity of the tetravalent BiKE were assessed using ELISA, flow cytometry, and biolayer interferometry. The ability of the BiKEs to kill cancer cells was evaluated through classical and residual antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. Additionally, we investigated the potential for NK cell fratricide via CD16a-CD16a crosslinking. Our results revealed that the tetravalent BiKE exhibited at least 100-fold higher affinity toward its target antigens compared to its bivalent counterpart. The residual ADCC assay indicated that the tetravalent BiKE was more effective in killing cancer cells than the bivalent BiKE, attributable to its lower K<sub>off</sub> value, which prolonged its binding to NK cell surfaces. Fratricide assays demonstrated that neither the bivalent nor the tetravalent BiKE mediated fratricide.

The current approach for predicting the likelihood of response to ICB is a single proportional biomarker (PD-L1) expressed in immune and tumor cells (Combined Positive Score, CPS) without differentiation by cell type, potentially explaining its limited predictive value. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) have shown a stronger association with ICB response than PD-L1. However, their exact composition, size, and spatial biology in HNSCC remain understudied. A detailed understanding of TLS is required for future use as a clinically applicable predictive biomarker. Pre-ICB tumor tissue sections were obtained from 9 responders (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 11 non-responders (progressive disease) classified via RECISTv1.1. A custom multi-immunofluorescence (mIF) staining assay was designed, optimized, and applied to characterize tumor cells (pan-cytokeratin), T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19, CD20), myeloid cells (CD16, CD56, CD163), dendritic cells (LAMP3), fibroblasts (α Smooth Muscle Actin), proliferative status (Ki67) and immunoregulatory molecules (PD1). Spatial metrics were compared among groups. Serial tissue sections were scored for TLS in both H&E and mIF slides. A machine learning model was employed to measure the effect of these metrics on achieving a response to ICB (SD, PR, or CR). A higher density of B lymphocytes (CD20+) was found in responders compared to non-responders to ICB (p=0.022). A positive correlation was observed between mIF and pathologist identification of TLS (<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> <i>= 0.66, p-value= <0.0001</i>). TLS trended toward being more prevalent in responders to ICB (p=0.0906). The presence of TLS within 100 μm of the tumor was associated with improved overall (p=0.04) and progression-free survival (p=0.03). A multivariate machine learning model identified TLS density as a leading predictor of response to ICB with 80% accuracy. Immune cell densities and TLS spatial location within the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the immune response to HNSCC and may potentially outperform CPS as a predictor of ICB response.",,"Ruiz-Torres, Daniel A|Bryan, Michael E|Hirayama, Shun|Merkin, Ross D|Luciani, Evelyn|Roberts, Thomas|Patel, Manisha|Park, Jong C|Wirth, Lori J|Sadow, Peter M|Sade-Feldman, Moshe|Stott, Shannon L|Faden, Daniel L",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,Journal Article|Preprint,2024,TR003793,1U18TR003793-01,phs002778.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on immune cell densities and their role in predicting responses to immune checkpoint blockade in head and neck cancer.

BMP signaling negatively regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in lung cancer cells. The impact of inhibiting BMP signaling on mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect this has on the survival of NSLC and leukemia cells are not known. Utilizing the BMP type 2 receptor (BMPR2) JL189, BMPR2 knockout (KO) in cancer cells, and BMP loss of function mutants in <i>C elegans</i>, we determined the effects of BMPR2 inhibition (BMPR2i) on TCA cycle metabolic intermediates, mitochondrial respiration, and the regulation of mitochondrial superoxide anion (SOA) and Ca<sup>++</sup> levels. We also examined whether BMPR2i altered the threshold cancer therapeutics induce cell death in NSLC and leukemia cell lines. KO of the mitochondria uniporter (MCU) was used to determine the mechanism BMPR2i regulates the uptake of Ca<sup>++</sup> into the mitochondria, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and cell death. BMPR2i increases mtCa<sup>++</sup> levels and enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in both NSLC and leukemia cell lines that is conserved in C elegans. BMPR2i induced increase in mtCa<sup>++</sup> levels is regulated through the MCU, effecting mitochondria mass and cell survival. BMPR2i synergistically induced cell death when combined with BCL-2 inhibitors or microtubule targeting agents in both NSLC and leukemia cells. Cell death is caused by synergistic increase in mitochondrial ROS and Ca<sup>++</sup> levels. BMPR2i enhances Ca<sup>++</sup> uptake into the mitochondria induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by cancer therapeutics.

These peptides interact with two G-protein coupled receptors, orexin 1 (OX<sub>1</sub>) and orexin 2 (OX<sub>2</sub>) receptors which are capable of coupling to all heterotrimeric G-protein subfamilies, but primarily transduce increases in calcium signalling. Orexin neurons are regulated by a variety of transmitter systems and environmental stimuli that signal reward availability, including food and drug related cues. Orexin neurons are also activated by anticipation, stress, cues predicting motivationally relevant information, including those predicting drugs of abuse, and engage neuromodulatory systems, including dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to respond to these signals. As such, orexin neurons have been characterized as motivational activators that coordinate a range of functions, including feeding and arousal, that allow the individual to respond to motivationally relevant information, critical for survival. This review focuses on the role of orexins in appetitive motivation and highlights a role for these neuropeptides in pathologies characterized by inappropriately high levels of motivated arousal (overeating, anxiety and substance use disorders) versus those in which motivation is impaired (depression).",Animals|Humans|Hypothalamus|Motivation|Neuropeptides|Orexin Receptors|Orexins|addiction|dopamine|eating|mesolimbic system|nucleus accumbens|orexin hypocretin|orexin reserve|paraventricular nucleus|ventral tegmental area,"Mohammadkhani, Aida|Mitchell, Caitlin|James, Morgan H|Borgland, Stephanie L|Dayas, Christopher V",British journal of pharmacology,Journal Article|Review,2024,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses the role of orexin/hypocretin circuits in motivation-related pathologies, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on developing a breathalyzer for COVID-19 detection.

Most research has been focused on how the two hormones regulate each other in terms of short-term pulses. Few studies have been conducted on the circadian relationship between the two hormones and how it differs between normal and abnormal groups. The circadian patterns are difficult to model as parametric functions. Directly extending univariate functional mixed effects models would result in a large dimensional problem and a challenging nonparametric inference. In this article, we propose a semi-parametric bivariate hierarchical state space model, in which each hormone profile is modeled by a hierarchical state space model, with nonparametric population-average and subject-specific components. The bivariate relationship is constructed by concatenating two latent independent subject-specific random functions specified by a design matrix, leading to a parametric inference on the correlation. We propose a computationally efficient state-space EM algorithm for estimation and inference.

Previously, we developed a method to measure VOCs emitted from well-differentiated tracheobronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Using this method, we exposed well-differentiated proximal (PECs) and distal airway epithelial cells (DECs) to varying doses of traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) and wildfire particulates to determine specific VOC signatures after exposure. We utilized PM2.5 TRAP collected from the Caldecott tunnel in Oakland, CA and the 2018 Camp Fire to model ""real-life"" exposures. The VOCs were collected and extracted from Twisters and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Exposure to both types of particulate matter (PM) resulted in specific VOC responses grouped by individual subjects with little overlap. Interestingly the VOCs produced by the PECs and DECs were also differentiated from each other.

Meanwhile, the rise of CRC in younger adults (Early-onset CRC), commonly diagnosed with a metastatic form of the disease, shows the pressing need to develop more effective targeted therapies to decrease the high mortality rates associated with metastatic disease. Hyperactivation of the Rictor-mTORC2-AKT signaling pathway drives key metastatic players in diverse malignant tumors, including early- and late-onset colorectal cancer. Selective mTORC2 inhibitors are becoming a potential treatment strategy for CRC due to the therapeutic limitations of mTORC1 inhibitors. Veratridine (VTD), a lipid-soluble alkaloid extracted from Liliaceae plants, can transcriptionally increase UBXN2A, which induces 26S proteasomal degradation of the Rictor protein, a key member in the mTORC2 complex. Destabilization of Rictor protein by VTD decreases Akt phosphorylation on Ser<sup>473</sup>, which is responsible for metastatic signaling downstream of the mTORC2 pathway in diverse malignant tumors. VTD decreases the population of metastatic colon cancer stem cells and functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor. VTD effectively reduces the spheroid growth rate and restricts cell migration. Live cell migration and invasion assays alongside biomechanical-force-based experiments revealed that VTD suppresses colon cancer cell invasiveness and the ensuing risk of tumor metastasis. A CRC mouse model that mimics the natural stages of human sporadic CRC revealed that VTD treatment significantly decreases tumor growth in a UBXN2A-dependent manner. This study showed a novel mechanistic connection between a ubiquitin-like protein and mTORC2-dependent migration and invasion in CRC tumors. This study revealed the therapeutic benefit of selective inhibition of Rictor in CRC, particularly in tumors with a hyperactive Rictor-mTORC2 signaling pathway.

Sputum cell RNA was used for whole-transcriptome gene network and viral metagenomic analyses.

The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed once-fatal HIV disease into a manageable chronic condition that now makes the need for VL testing which aims to satisfy international suppression targets 95-95-95 al l the more essential. Therefore, considering the complexity and diversity of HIV infection, it is essential to develop rapid diagnostic technologies suitable for different clinical situations. Here, we report on a multiplexed PCR device developed for simple and efficient quantification of HIV-1 or HIV-2 viral loads using finger-pricked whole blood from rural decentralized settings. This device is comprised of a previously developed RNA extraction module combined with an optimized real-time PCR amplification system. Together, these combine to simultaneously detect and differentiate HIV-1 & 2; as well are adopting a testing control of RNase P allowing for full diagnostic analysis from one sample. Our device also includes an intuitive user interface and is completely autonomous so it can serve individuals in remote areas who are unfamiliar with the field of medical testing. They get the results in a very short time of around 70 min and hence save on testing times without leaving accuracy behind. The efficiency and effectiveness of the device were validated through the analysis of 30 clinical samples, yielding a sensitivity of 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The specificity was found to be 100% for HIV-1 and 90.91% for HIV-2, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. One of the most attractive things about this device is that it comes in comparison to all other counterparts. Given that you can run the assay for less than $10, it could be an economically viable way to use this as a broadscale test in regions where healthcare budgets don't allow others. Hence it is quite a useful device to aid HIV management in resource-limited settings, where conventional laboratory facilities are out of reach due its simplicity and affordability with rapid output. The point-of-care test is an effective, low-cost, high quality diagnostic tool-promoting rapid testing for HIV-inexpensively overcoming the barriers to efficient control of and care in resource-limited settings.","Biosensing Techniques|Equipment Design|HIV Infections|HIV-1|HIV-2|Human immunodeficiency viruses|Humans|Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction|Nucleic acid testing|Quantification|RNA, Viral|Resource-Limited Settings|Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|Self-testing|Viral Load|Viral load","Liu, Tianyi|Politza, Anthony J|Ahamed, Md Ahasan|Kshirsagar, Aneesh|Zhu, Yusheng|Guan, Weihua",Biosensors & bioelectronics,Journal Article,2025,HD105610,1R61HD105610-01,phs002549.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,2.0,"The publication abstract describes a compact multiplex PCR device for HIV viral load determination, which is unrelated to the research objectives of the funding opportunity and grant abstract focused on SARS-CoV-2 in children.

There were differences in intima-media lumen thickness (IMT), arterial velocities, and inflammatory markers in post-COVID-19 patients. There was no instance of deep vein thrombosis in this post-COVID-19 study cohort. The increased IMT might infer atherosclerosis, which has shown to increase cardiovascular risks. It is not yet known whether the increase in IMT due to COVID should be treated in the same way as non-COVID-19 atherosclerosis-through statins, for example-or whether regular cardiovascular risk reduction would be useful.

LDX treatment is generally effective at reducing binge eating symptoms but is associated with several unwanted side effects. How BED patients perceive the therapeutic efficacy vs. associated side effects of LDX has not been explored. We carried out a thematic analysis of 111 online reviews posted to the website Drugs. com by persons prescribed LDX to treat BED. We also explored how qualitative themes were associated with perceptions of treatment efficacy on a quantitative (1-10 scale) scale. Themes associated with higher efficacy ratings included improved binge eating outcomes, enhanced focus/concentration, as well as weight loss (χ<sup>2</sup> tests, p's < 0.05). Lower efficacy ratings were associated with themes that included tolerance to therapeutic effects of LDX, insomnia, return of binge eating in the evening, loss of energy in the afternoon/evening ('crashing'), and weight gain (χ<sup>2</sup> tests, p's < 0.05). Limitations of the study include representativeness of the data and self-reported BED diagnosis.

We examined the impact of the pandemic on the diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the United States. We performed a historical cohort study using US commercial insurance data (2016-2021) to identify children aged <18 years without prior JIA diagnosis or treatment in the prior ≥12 months. New JIA diagnoses were identified using a combination of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, location, and timing of medical services. Crude rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of JIA diagnosis per 100,000 enrolled children per quarter were estimated and stratified by age group, sex, region, JIA type, and uveitis. The incidence rate ratio (95% CI) for JIA diagnosis was estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for various demographic variables. From 2018-2021, 643 children were diagnosed with JIA. Crude new JIA diagnoses per 100,000 children per quarter dropped from 2.62 (95% CI, 2.39-2.87) prepandemic to 1.94 (95% CI, 1.66-2.25) during the pandemic. Declines in JIA diagnosis were more apparent in the US Northeast and West regions and among children aged 6-11 years. After adjustment for covariates, JIA diagnoses fell by 30% during the pandemic compared with the prior 3 years (IRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83). Compared with the prepandemic period, JIA was diagnosed 30% less often during the early pandemic among commercially insured children in the United States.

We have identified a drug lead, named MGC-10, which kills Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), with a MIC of 6 µM, while being harmless to mammalian cells <i>in vitro</i> in that concentration range. The antibacterial activity of MGC-10 was broad against over 50 strains of antibiotic-resistant samples obtained from hospital infections, where MGC-10 inhibited all tested strains of MRSA. Extensive selection and screening with MGC-10 did not yield any resistant strains, indicating it may have universal antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i>. Pharmacokinetics performed in mice suggested that MGC-10 was too toxic for systemic use; however, it appears to have potential as a topical treatment for difficult-to-treat wounds or skin infections by Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. In a mouse skin-infection model with MRSA, MGC-10 performed as well or better than the present topical drug of choice, mupirocin. MGC-10 showed little, if any, accumulation in the livers of topically treated mice. These results bode well for the future use of MGC-10 in clinical application as it could be used to treat a broad range of <i>S. aureus</i> skin infections that are resistant to known antibiotics.IMPORTANCEThere is a critical need for new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections caused by pathogens resistant to many if not all currently available antibiotics. We describe here the identification of a prospective new antibiotic from high-throughput screening of a chemical library. The screening was designed to detect the inhibition of formation of a complex required for bacterial protein synthesis in all bacteria, the ""ternary complex,"" comprised of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), aminoacyl-tRNA, and GTP. The inhibitory compound, renamed MGC-10, was effective against all Gram-positive bacteria, including a wide variety of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) strains. Although apparently too toxic for systemic use, the compound was safe and effective for topical use for treating skin infections in a mouse model. No resistance to the compound has been detected thus far, suggesting the potential to develop this compound for topical use to treat infections, especially those caused by pathogens resistant to existing antibiotics.","(R,R)-tetrahydrochrysene|Administration, Topical|Animals|Anti-Bacterial Agents|Chlorocebus aethiops|FRET|Female|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer|High-Throughput Screening Assays|Male|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Microbial Sensitivity Tests|Peptide Elongation Factor Tu|Protein Binding|RNA, Transfer|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Staphylococcal Skin Infections|Staphylococcus aureus|Vero Cells|ternary complex in protein synthesis|topical antibiotic for Gram-positive pathogens","Mandecki, Wlodek|Chudaev, Maxim|Ye, Wenjuan|Wang, Amy Q|Wilson, Kenneth J|Xu, Xin|Kim, Jisun|Parker, Dane|Alland, David|Kumar, Pradeep|Li, Barry|Yang, Jason H|Kreiswirth, Barry|Mediavilla, Jose R|Marugan, Juan J|Henderson, Mark J|Goldman, Emanuel",Applied and environmental microbiology,Journal Article,2025,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on the identification of a new antibiotic, MGC-10, targeting MRSA skin infections.

Many factors have contributed to this paucity, including the biological complexity of addiction, regulatory challenges, and a historical lack of enthusiasm among pharmaceutical companies to commit resources to this disease space. Despite these headwinds, the recent opioid crisis has highlighted the devastating consequences of SUDs for both individuals and society, stimulating urgent efforts to identify novel treatment approaches. In addition, several neurobiological systems have been recently implicated in unique aspects of drug reward, opening the door to candidate medications with novel mechanisms of action. Here, we provide an overview of efforts to target several of these new systems, with a focus on those that are the subject of ongoing clinical trials as well as being areas of interest among the authors' research groups (MHJ, MTB, NAE). Specifically, we discuss new classes of medications targeting the serotonin 2A receptor (i.e., psychedelics), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, cannabidiol, dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor, orexin/hypocretin, and oxytocin receptor systems, as well as emergent approaches for modulating the more canonical dopaminergic system via agonist therapies for stimulant use disorders.

Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers, thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade could be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low-density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Recently, specific lichen-microbial community associations have been proposed. In this study, we aimed to characterize the differences in bacteria associated with closely related lichens, under a defined set of environmental conditions in Colombian paramos. Our goal was to determine if there is a correlation between microbiota and host divergence in lichen species belonging to the genus Sticta. We found that specific microbiota are defined by their mycobiont at the genus level. Further, distinct bacterial families show differences among the three studied genera, and specific amplicon sequence variants further discriminate among lichen species within each genus. A geographic component also determines the composition of these microbial communities among lichen species.

However, the process remains a ""black box"" and does not help clinicians in understanding the electrocardiographic changes at an individual level. we propose a nonparametric feature extraction approach to identify features that are associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). We apply functional principal component analysis to the raw ECG tracings collected in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. We define and select the features using ECGs from participants enrolled in Phase I (2003-2008) of the study. Cox proportional hazards models are used to evaluate the association of selected ECG features and their changes with the incident risk of AF during study follow-up. The findings are then validated in ECGs from participants enrolled in Phase III (2013-2015). We identify four features that are related to the P-wave amplitude, QRS complex and ST segment. Both their initial measurement and 3-year changes are associated with the development of AF. In particular, one standard deviation in the 3-year decline of the P-wave amplitude is independently associated with a 29% increased risk of incident AF in the multivariable model (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: [1.16, 1.43]).

NKCEs offer a significant advancement over conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by enhancing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). They achieve this by stably and selectively binding to both NK cell activating receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Unlike traditional mAbs, which depend on the relatively transient interaction between their Fc region and CD16a, NKCEs establish more robust connections with a range of activating receptors (e.g., CD16a, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, NKG2C) and inhibitory receptors (e.g., Siglec-7) on NK cells, thereby increasing cancer cell killing efficacy and specificity. This review article critically examines the strategies for engineering bi-, tri-, and multi-specific NKCEs for cancer immunotherapy, providing an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements in NKCE platform technologies currently under development by pharmaceutical and biotech companies and discussing the preclinical and clinical progress of these products. While NKCEs show great promise, the review underscores the need for continued research to optimize their therapeutic efficacy and to overcome obstacles related to NK cell functionality in cancer patients.

Drug level feedback (DLF) can support dose optimization and timely interventions to prevent treatment failure, but current tests are heavily instrumented and centralized. We developed the REverse transcriptase ACTivity crispR (REACTR) for rapid measurement of HIV drugs based on the extent of DNA synthesis by HIV reverse transcriptase. CRISPR-Cas enzymes bind to the synthesized DNA, triggering collateral cleavage of quenched reporters and generating fluorescence. We measured azidothymidine triphosphate (AZT-TP), a key drug in pediatric HIV treatment, and investigated the impact of assay time and DNA template length on REACTR's sensitivity. REACTR selectively measured clinically relevant AZT-TP concentrations in the presence of genomic DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysate.

The combined positive score (CPS) for PD-L1 is the only biomarker approved to predict response to ICB and has limited performance. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) have shown promising potential for predicting response to ICB. However, their exact composition, size, and spatial biology in HNSCC remain understudied. To elucidate the impact of TLS spatial biology in response to ICB, we utilized pre-ICB tumor tissue sections from 9 responders (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 11 non-responders (progressive disease) classified via RECISTv1.1. A custom multi-immunofluorescence (mIF) staining assay was applied to characterize tumor cells (pan-cytokeratin), T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19, CD20), myeloid cells (CD16, CD56, CD163), dendritic cells (LAMP3), fibroblasts (α Smooth Muscle Actin), proliferative status (Ki67) and immunoregulatory molecules (PD1). A machine learning model was employed to measure the effect of spatial metrics on achieving a response to ICB. A higher density of B cells (CD20+) was found in responders compared to non-responders to ICB (<i>p</i> = 0.022). The presence of TLS within 100 µm of the tumor was associated with improved overall (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and progression-free survival (<i>p</i> = 0.03). A multivariate machine learning model identified TLS density as a leading predictor of response to ICB with 80% accuracy. Immune cell densities and TLS spatial location play a critical role in the response to ICB in HNSCC and may potentially outperform CPS as a predictor of response.","Aged|Biomarkers, Tumor|Female|Head and Neck Neoplasms|Head and neck cancer|Humans|Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors|Male|Middle Aged|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck|Tertiary Lymphoid Structures|Tumor Microenvironment|immune checkpoint blockade|spatial biology|tertiary lymphoid structures","Ruiz-Torres, Daniel A|Bryan, Michael E|Hirayama, Shun|Merkin, Ross D|Luciani, Evelyn|Roberts, Thomas J|Patel, Manisha|Park, Jong C|Wirth, Lori J|Sadow, Peter M|Sade-Feldman, Moshe|Stott, Shannon L|Faden, Daniel L",Oncoimmunology,Journal Article,2025,TR003793,1U18TR003793-01,phs002778.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Exosome,1.0,"The publication abstract focuses on tertiary lymphoid structures and their role in predicting immune checkpoint blockade response in head and neck cancer, which is unrelated to the funding opportunity and grant abstract that address SARS-CoV-2 detection using microfluidic technology.","The publication abstract is not related to the research objectives of the funding opportunity or the grant abstract.

Existing biomarkers have limited ability to predict treatment response or survival, exposing many patients to the potential toxicity of treatment without certain clinical benefit. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a non-invasive, real-time biomarker that could address these challenges. We analyzed 137 plasma samples from 16 patients with R/M HNSCC undergoing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapy. A tumor-informed, highly sensitive next-generation sequencing liquid biopsy assay (RaDaR, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc.) was applied to track ctDNA changes at baseline and throughout treatment. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between ctDNA negativity and key clinical outcomes: disease control (best objective response of stable disease, partial response, or complete response), three-year overall survival (OS), and three-year progression-free survival (PFS).

We aimed to compare odor identification between SCD and cognitively normal (CN) stages and investigate whether cognitive differences moderate olfactory deficits. A systematic search of four databases identified studies assessing olfactory identification and cognitive screening in individuals aged 50+. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on 11 studies (660 SCD, 574 CN). Individuals with SCD exhibited lower olfactory identification scores compared to CN participants (SMD = -0.67, 95%CI [-1.31, -0.03], <i>p</i> = .04). Meta-regression revealed a negative association (β = -1.79, p = .02) between cognitive and olfactory differences, indicating that greater cognitive decline was not consistently associated with greater olfactory deficits, lower odor identification scores in SCD occurred despite minimal cognitive differences across groups. Odor identification is lower in pre-MCI individuals reporting SCD. Olfactory decline may emerge independently prior to measurable cognitive decline, supporting the role of odor identification as a screen for AD.",Alzheimer’s disease|Biomarker|Meta-Analysis|Olfaction|Olfactory identification|Smell|Subjective cognitive decline,"Jobin, Benoît|Zigrand, Coline|Frasnelli, Johannes|Boller, Benjamin|Albers, Mark W",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,Journal Article|Preprint,2025,DC019579,4U01DC019579-03,phs002964.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing,2.0,"The publication abstract discusses the relationship between odor identification and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, specifically in the context of subjective cognitive decline.

While many drugs target the causative factors, none directly stimulate mucosal wound healing. We found that the specific focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activator, M64HCl, promotes intestinal mucosal healing in mice. This study aims to further validate the therapeutic impact of M64HCl on intestinal mucosal repair in rats as a second species. Wistar rats were assigned to one of four groups: normal control, 1-day injury + vehicle, 4-day injury + vehicle, or 4-day injury + M64HCl. Intestinal injury was induced by serosally applying 75% acetic acid. Immediately after injury, rats received either a continuous infusion of M64HCl (25 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle (saline). Four days post-injury, blood was drawn to measure M64HCl levels and assess liver and kidney function. The intestines were removed and opened, ulcer areas were photographed for size quantification, and tissues were fixed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. M64HCl substantially reduced ulcer area on gross examination, while histological analysis showed alleviation of pathological changes with M64HCl treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed increased immunoreactivity for phosphorylated FAK in the epithelium adjacent to the injury in M64HCl-treated rats. However, there was no change in the percentage of Ki67-positive cells in each crypt at the edge of the ulcer area. Serum creatinine, ALT, and AST levels did not differ between the 4-day injury groups with or without M64HCl treatment. M64HCl, a water-soluble FAK activator, promotes acetic acid-induced ulcer healing in rats and may be useful in treating gastrointestinal mucosal injury.","Acetic Acid|Animals|Disease Models, Animal|Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases|Focal adhesion kinase|Intestinal Mucosa|Male|Mucosal healing|Rats|Rats, Wistar|Small intestine, mucosal injury|Wound Healing","Liu, Guiming|Elsayed, Ahmed Adham R|Kwantwi, Louis Boafo|Gallardo-Macias, Ricardo|Gurvich, Vadim J|Basson, Marc D",BMC gastroenterology,Journal Article,2025,HL152410,1U01HL152410-01,phs002522.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.0,"The publication abstract discusses the use of M64HCl, a focal adhesion kinase activator, in promoting intestinal mucosal healing in rats.

Jun12682 and PF-07957472 are the first-in-class PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors showing potent in vivo antiviral efficacy in mouse models. In this study, we characterize naturally occurring mutations at residues located at the drug-binding site of Jun12682. The results reveal several PL<sup>pro</sup> mutants showing significant drug resistance while maintaining comparable enzymatic activity as the wild-type PL<sup>pro</sup>. The physiological relevance of the identified drug-resistant mutants, including E167G and Q269H, is validated through independent serial viral passage experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations and perturbative free energy calculations show that drug-resistant PL<sup>pro</sup> mutants weaken hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions. Collectively, this study identifies E167, Y268, and Q269 as drug-resistant hotspots for PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors that bind to the BL2 loop and groove region, which are valuable in informing the design of the next-generation PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors.","Animals|Antiviral Agents|Binding Sites|COVID-19|Coronavirus 3C Proteases|Coronavirus Papain-Like Proteases|Drug Resistance, Viral|Humans|Hydrogen Bonding|Molecular Dynamics Simulation|Mutation|SARS-CoV-2","Tan, Haozhou|Zhang, Qianru|Georgiou, Kyriakos|Zhang, Siyu|Li, Kan|Lambrinidis, George|Kolocouris, Antonios|Deng, Xufang|Wang, Jun",Nature communications,Journal Article,2025,HL150852,5U01HL150852-02,phs002583.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,1.5,"The publication abstract focuses on identifying drug-resistant mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) and characterizing their impact on inhibitor efficacy.

They majorly serve as a communication channel between cells. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are gaining wide attention in several pathophysiological conditions and are considered as early diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recently, exosomal miRNAs have been identified as key players during obesity and coexisting risk elements, unraveling their pivotal role in the progression of obesity induced pathophysiological conditions.
