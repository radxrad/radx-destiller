35953484,PMC9366802,doi:10.1038/s41467-022-32406-w,SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens are detected in continuous air samples from congregate settings.,"Two years after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there is still a need for better ways to assess the risk of transmission in congregate spaces. We deployed active air samplers to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real-world settings across communities in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Over 29 weeks, we collected 527 air samples from 15 congregate settings. We detected 106 samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in continuous air samples collected from a variety of real-world settings. We expanded the utility of air surveillance to test for 40 other respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data revealed differences in timing and location of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus detection. In addition, we obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from air samples to identify variant lineages. Collectively, this shows air sampling is a scalable, high throughput surveillance tool that could be used in conjunction with other methods for detecting respiratory pathogens in congregate settings.","COVID-19|Humans|Minnesota|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wisconsin","Ramuta, Mitchell D|Newman, Christina M|Brakefield, Savannah F|Stauss, Miranda R|Wiseman, Roger W|Kita-Yarbro, Amanda|O'Connor, Eli J|Dahal, Neeti|Lim, Ailam|Poulsen, Keith P|Safdar, Nasia|Marx, John A|Accola, Molly A|Rehrauer, William M|Zimmer, Julia A|Khubbar, Manjeet|Beversdorf, Lucas J|Boehm, Emma C|Casta√±eda, David|Rushford, Clayton|Gregory, Devon A|Yao, Joseph D|Bhattacharyya, Sanjib|Johnson, Marc C|Aliota, Matthew T|Friedrich, Thomas C|O'Connor, David H|O'Connor, Shelby L",Nature communications,2022,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DA053893,U01,False,Wastewater,1U01DA053893-01,phs002679.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Wastewater Detection of COVID-19,COVID-19,"When faced with a pandemic such as SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, timely risk assessment and action are required to prevent public health impacts to entire communities. Because infected individuals may not have access to testing or may be asymptomatic, a proactive approach to detect the virus and to develop public health strategy to mitigate virus spread is needed. Recent studies have detected SAR-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage and demonstrated a positive correlation between the concentration of viral markers and reported cases1-5. The Coronavirus Sewershed Surveillance Project (CSSP) is a collaborative effort to monitor sewersheds for genetic indicators of COVID-19 in wastewater and to provide additional, population-level information about virus circulation that is not captured by clinical testing. Untreated wastewater (influent) samples are screened weekly from selected sewersheds and targeted micro-sewersheds for detection and &#8220;true&#8221; prevalence. Congregate facilities provide unique opportunities for study, because they are controlled populations where the precise number and timing of infections can be defined. Our team will utilize detailed monitoring of congregate facilities to define the precise per patient contribution and longevity of SARS-COV-2 RNA to wastewater by 1) increasing the number of tested facilities, 2) altering the frequency at which samples are collected, and 3) comparing collected sewershed data to clinical patient case data. Although SARS-COV-2 contribution/patient varies among communities, there have been clear outlier communities that produce little or no genetic material in the wastewater, despite the presence of known outbreaks. The reason for this lost signal is not known, so our team will define factors that contribute to SARS-COV-2 signal suppression in wastewater by 1) defining the physical nature of the genetic material in the sewershed to better understand the types of factors that could suppress signal, 2) expanding testing within sewersheds with suppressed signal and from additional facilities with similar population and industry demographics as those with suppressed signal to narrow the sources of signal suppression, 3) performing exhaustive chemical characterization to compare wastewater in suppressed locations and not suppressed locations, in order to identify candidate compounds that could be causing suppression, and 4) obtaining or generating candidate inhibitors and testing their ability to suppress signal from viral genetic material in a controlled experimental setting. Our team will further evaluate the utility of using wastewater RNA to determine what viral variants are circulating in a community. Towards this, we will 1) evaluate different methods, such as variant specific qPCR and targeted high throughput sequencing, for characterizing genetic material in wastewater, 2) develop methods for evaluating existing and emerging variants from wastewater, and 3) design platforms for communicating wastewater variant results to the public.

Background/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Given this, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx program is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the DCC funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nBecause traces of COVID-19 can be detected in human effluent, wastewater (i.e. sewage) sample testing can be an efficient and effective way to test defined population areas for the presence of COVID-19. Wastewater-based testing can be used alongside national and local data sources to provide cost-effective and objective measures of the presence of a specific compound (e.g., drug, virus). For over 20 years, wastewater-based testing (WBT), initially proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, has been used in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. to test for the presence and extent of substance use in communities. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has also been successfully used as a surveillance tool for SARS, hepatitis A, and polio. Recent ongoing studies based on WBT with COVID-19 have provided an earlier prediction of an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, compared to data provided by individual-level testing, suggesting the possibility of using these data to inform early containment and mitigation measurements./nHistorically, wastewater analysis approaches have focused on downstream sample collection, namely at the water treatment plants, which provides broad, city-level sampling that cannot be directly used to guide more localized estimates and related interventions. More recent novel approaches have focused on upstream sample collection, which allows for more granular, community- and neighborhood-level resolution. Advantages of such an approach, compared to individual-level testing, include the ability to capture a broader population size, the ability to be deployed in communities where individual-level testing may be difficult to implement, and anonymity of testing, which may reduce barriers to testing related to stigma. Community-level sampling can also be deployed in settings with a high risk of disease transmission (e.g., criminal justice facilities, assisted living/nursing home facilities, dormitories), within communities that are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions or other factors, and in areas with marginalized populations where access to or utilization of healthcare services, including individualized testing, may be limited. WBT-based surveillance can provide detailed mapping of the extent and spread of COVID-19 and has been shown to be orders of magnitude less expensive and faster than clinical screening, albeit serving as a complementary approach rather than substituting for individual-level testing and screening. Early engagement of communities in the identification of testing sites and implementation of testing, as well as dissemination of the data produced and reporting back to the community, may also improve compliance with community guidance aimed at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigation strategies. Longer-term, the approaches developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater could be leveraged to enable creation of early warning systems for future outbreaks of known and emerging pathogens./nResearch in response to this FOA can be proposed to address any aspect of wastewater-based testing, including but not limited to the following /nInvestigation of specific approaches aiming to inform and optimize wastewater sample collection. /nDemonstration and optimization of wastewater sample analysis approaches. /nDevelopment of optimized intervention strategies. /nIncorporation of computational, statistical, and mathematical models. /nProjects that do not have an infrastructure to rapidly report study findings and impact to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed./nLeveraging Existing Research Resources  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies whenever possible. NIH has developed innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality, and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public through programs such as  NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hubs (REACH), Small Business Education and Entrepreneurial Development (SEED) for assistance in proof of concept and commercialization of a marketable product.

FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant‚Äôs integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205  Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.  This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships./nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Parts 75 and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies./nThe administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below./nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for /nNIH will assign a Program Official, Project Scientist(s), and a Grants Management Specialist to each project./nNIH staff has substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below /nNIH Project Scientist(s) will have substantial scientific involvement during the conduct of this activity, through technical assistance, advice, and coordination.

NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices

",4,"The publication abstract describes a study on detecting SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in air samples from congregate settings. While the primary focus of the funding opportunity and grant abstract is on wastewater-based testing (WBT) for COVID-19 surveillance, the publication's methodology and objectives are related in that both aim to improve public health responses through innovative surveillance methods. The publication's use of air sampling as a complementary approach aligns with the broader goals of the RADx-rad initiative, which seeks to develop non-traditional methods for virus detection. Although the specific focus on wastewater in the funding opportunity and grant abstract is not directly addressed in the publication, the research objectives of enhancing surveillance capabilities and providing additional data for public health strategies are shared. Therefore, the publication is relevant but not directly aligned with the specific wastewater-based approach outlined in the funding opportunity and grant abstract.",DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,12163,192,3.9,0.0
