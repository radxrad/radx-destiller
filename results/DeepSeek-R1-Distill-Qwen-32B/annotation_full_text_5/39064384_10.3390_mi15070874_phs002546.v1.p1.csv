39064384,PMC11279040,doi:10.3390/mi15070874,Batch-to-Batch Variation in Laser-Inscribed Graphene (LIG) Electrodes for Electrochemical Sensing.,"Laser-inscribed graphene (LIG) is an emerging material for micro-electronic applications and is being used to develop supercapacitors, soft actuators, triboelectric generators, and sensors. The fabrication technique is simple, yet the batch-to-batch variation of LIG quality is not well documented in the literature. In this study, we conduct experiments to characterize batch-to-batch variation in the manufacturing of LIG electrodes for applications in electrochemical sensing. Numerous batches of 36 LIG electrodes were synthesized using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser system on polyimide film. The LIG material was characterized using goniometry, stereomicroscopy, open circuit potentiometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Hydrophobicity and electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry) indicate that LIG electrode batch-to-batch variation is less than 5% when using a commercial reference and counter electrode. Metallization of LIG led to a significant increase in peak current and specific capacitance (area between anodic/cathodic curve). However, batch-to-batch variation increased to approximately 30%. Two different platinum electrodeposition techniques were studied, including galvanostatic and frequency-modulated electrodeposition. The study shows that formation of metallized LIG electrodes with high specific capacitance and peak current may come at the expense of high batch variability. This design tradeoff has not been discussed in the literature and is an important consideration if scaling sensor designs for mass use is desired. This study provides important insight into the variation of LIG material properties for scalable development of LIG sensors. Additional studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of this variability so that strategies to improve the repeatability may be developed for improving quality control. The dataset from this study is available via an open access repository.",LIG|batch|laser-inscribed graphene|manufacturing|scalability|sensor|variation,"Tang, Yifan|Moreira, Geisianny A|Vanegas, Diana|Datta, Shoumen P A|McLamore, Eric S",Micromachines,2024,Journal Article,AA029328,U01,False,Automatic Detection & Tracing,1U01AA029328-01,phs002546.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Development of an Automated Diagnostic Platform for SARS-CoV-2 Monitoring in Vulnerable Areas,COVID-19,"The devastation caused by emerging pathogens with fast transmission capacity, such as SARS-CoV-2, has demonstrated the importance of preparedness for future viral outbreaks; this includes the ability for fast deployment of in-situ testing tools and epidemiological surveillance with high temporal and spatial resolution; particularly in places that are most vulnerable to becoming reservoirs of infectious agents. We propose to develop a versatile multiplexing detection platform for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The proposed system will integrate signals from different biorecognition elements. Aptamer, antibody, and ACE2 will be immobilized onto laser inscribed graphene electrodes, and detection mechanisms targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein will be studied under varying testing conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength). After determining the operating conditions for enhanced performance of each biosensor, a self-referencing approach will be used between complementary recognition elements (i.e., possible combinations of aptamers, antibodies, and ACE2 enzyme biosensors) to evaluate the effects on test results accuracy (i.e., risk of false-positive and false-negative results). A saliva pre-treatment protocol will be developed to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 testing in human saliva using the multiplex biosensor platform. An open channel microfluidics system will be designed to automatically split and channel a single saliva sample into multiple streams to the biosensors without saturation, biofouling, and pump requirement. The development of a functional and reliable multiplex biosensor system will be useful for addressing longstanding needs in public health as the respiratory coronavirus family continues its seasonal visits, which may repeat over several decades, much like the occasional visits from the influenza virus, with varying degrees of virulence.",RFA-OD-20-014,Emergency Awards: Automatic Detection and Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 (U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed),https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-20-014.html,"EXPIRED/nNational Institutes of Health (NIH)/n/nOffice of The Director, National Institutes of Health (OD)

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions./nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review./nPurpose/nNIH is issuing this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) in response to the declared public health emergency issued by the Secretary, HHS, for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This emergency FOA from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides an expedited funding mechanism as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. The overall goal of the RADx-rad initiative is to solicit proposals for the development of novel, non-traditional approaches to identify the current SARS-CoV-2 virus or other markers of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) that can be used for future COVID-19 outbreaks and that could be applicable to other, as yet unknown, viruses. Specifically, this FOA will support the early stage development of an innovative platform that integrates biosensing with touchscreen or other digital devices to achieve automatic detection and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in real-time. Projects funded under this FOA should demonstrate proof-of-concept of SARS-CoV-2 detection with high sensitivity and specificity, sensor functionality, and automatic signal transduction and detection by touchscreen or other digital devices./nThe funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nBackground/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Given this, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx program is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs a part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. This may include unconventional screening, biological or physiological markers, new platforms, and point-of-care devices that address current gaps in COVID-19 testing. Despite the variety of activities included, the overall RADx-rad effort will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nProject Specifics/nThis FOA aims to support proof-of-concept projects to develop a virus-sensing platform that integrates biosensing with touchscreen or other digital devices to achieve automatic virus detection, tracing, and data collection in real-time./nOne of the critical challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic is the early detection of SARS-CoV-2. The touchscreen is an interface between our hands and the information transmission of digital devices, which has been widely used for cell phones, tablets, and other devices for educational and commercial purposes. Viruses are frequently spread through touching surfaces via the hands; as such, surface detection of viruses on touchscreen devices provides an opportunity for early detection of viral pathogens. This FOA encourages the proof-of-concept research to develop an innovative platform that is capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity and automatically transmitting the information to a touchscreen or other digital device./nThis platform may integrate aptamers or other biorecognition elements for virus sensing. Aptamers are short strands of DNA or RNA that can bind to targets with high specificity and affinity. Aptamers have been widely used for biosensing of various targets, from small molecules to microorganisms, including viruses. To achieve automatic virus detection, aptamers, or other virus recognition elements, that bind to SARS-CoV-2 or its signature molecules are immobilized on virus sensing and transduction material (VSTM). Binding of the aptamer to the virus will trigger electrical, optical, or other types of signals, which can be captured by the touchscreen or other digital device. The VSTM may take the form of a specialized screen protector for the surface of touchscreen devices./nThis technology will have wide-reaching possibilities and can be integrated into a variety of different platforms beyond touchscreen devices. For example, VSTM can be integrated into keyboard, mouse and other frequently touched surfaces. Furthermore, integrating VSTM into the surface of specialized virus detectors can enable detection of viruses in respiratory droplets in the air. Installation of such detectors at public places, such as senior living centers, hospitals, airplanes, and meeting spaces, will allow the early detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in the community. The use of such devices in assisted living, skilled nursing facilities or group homes will inform the early detection that helps to protect COVID-19 vulnerable populations. Lastly, the integration of this novel platform with other digital apps for health and disease conditions will capture the immediate impact of viruses or other pathogens on health and behavior in real-time./nThe proof-of-concept applications responding to this FOA should focus on innovative approaches and optimal strategies for virus sensing, signal conversion, and detection. The projects are expected to be built upon rigorous scientific rationale, to establish the technical feasibility, and to achieve the following four objectives within the two-year project period /nObjectives/nThrough these objectives, this FOA aims to support proof-of-concept projects of automatic detection and tracing of SARS-CoV-2, which may be applicable to detect other pathogens by changing the specificity of the virus sensing element. Applications that propose to use other biorecognition element, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), instead of aptamers, to detect virus are considered to be within the scope of the RFA./nIt is expected that the research team with complementary expertise will achieve all four objectives. If the application only addresses one, two, or three objectives, the applicant must provide a strong justification. /nMilestones /nThe proposed project should be milestone-driven with a clear project timeline. Milestones are goals that measure success and efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project and should have quantitative criteria associated with them. Applicants are required to provide scientifically rigorous milestones that include the following details /nA clear description of milestones to be used for measuring success in achieving the research plan. One or more milestones should be used for each objective. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone./nDetailed quantitative criteria for measuring success and the rationale for the quantitative criteria. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art in the field./nA project timeline in the form of a Gantt chart, that includes all milestones described in the text, should be included.

FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205  Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.  This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships./nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies./nThe administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below./nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for /nNIH Science Officer is a designated NIH Program Staff, who will have substantial programmatic involvement, as described below and will be named in the Notice of Award (NoA) /nNIH Program Staff designated as the Program Official/Director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the awards and will be named in the Notice of Award (NoA). NIH Program Official/Director may recommend withholding of support, suspension, or termination of the award for lack of adherence to required policies and/or procedures, and lack of adherence to the goals of the FOA./nNIH Program Staff may not have dual role as the Science Officer and Program Official/Director./nAreas of Joint Responsibility include /nThe PD(s)/PI(s) and the NIH Science Officer will participate in regularly scheduled meetings to coordinate implementation and evaluation of the ongoing projects, plan collaborative efforts, assist in analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of scientific findings. Additionally, the PIs and the NIH Science Officer will participate in RAdx initiative meetings to present major progress./nDispute Resolution Process /nAny disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members  a designee of the awardee, an NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16./nFunds awarded using appropriations provided by the  Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, Public Law 116-139  will be issued in unique subaccounts in the HHS Payment Management System and will require separate financial reporting from any other funds awarded./nAnnual reports of progress need to be submitted to the DCC and the NIH.

",3,"The publication abstract discusses batch-to-batch variation in laser-inscribed graphene (LIG) electrodes for electrochemical sensing. While this is related to the materials used in the grant's proposed biosensor platform, it does not directly address the specific objectives of developing an automated diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 monitoring. The grant focuses on integrating biosensing elements and developing a multiplex detection system, whereas the publication is more about material characterization and variability, which is a supporting aspect but not central to the grant's main goals.",DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,11908,122,2.6,0.0
