36082611,,doi:10.1542/hpeds.2022-006524,Examining the Association Between MIS-C and the Child Opportunity Index at a Single Center.,"To describe associations between the Child Opportunity Index (COI) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood (MIS-C) diagnosis among hospitalized children. We used a retrospective case control study design to examine children â‰¤21 years hospitalized at a single, tertiary care children's hospital between March 2020 and June 2021. Our study population included children diagnosed with MIS-C (n = 111) and a control group of children hospitalized for MIS-C evaluation who had an alternative diagnosis (n = 61). Census tract COI was the exposure variable, determined using the patient's home address mapped to the census tract. Our outcome measure was MIS-C diagnosis. Odds ratios measured associations between COI and MIS-C diagnosis. Our study population included 111 children diagnosed with MIS-C and 61 children evaluated but ruled out for MIS-C. The distribution of census tract overall COI differed significantly between children diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children with an alternate diagnosis (P = .03). Children residing in census tracts with very low to low overall COI (2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-6.17) and very low to low health/environment COI (4.69, 95% CI 2.21-9.97) had significantly higher odds of being diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children living in moderate and high to very high COI census tracts, respectively. Census tract child opportunity is associated with MIS-C diagnosis among hospitalized children suggesting an important contribution of place-based determinants in the development of MIS-C.",COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Child|Hospitalization|Humans|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2,"Tyris, Jordan|Boggs, Kaitlyn|Bost, James|Dixon, Gabrina|Gayle, Tamara|Harahsheh, Ashraf S|Sharron, Matthew P|Majumdar, Suvankar|Krishnan, Anita|Smith, Karen|Goyal, Monika K|Parikh, Kavita",Hospital pediatrics,2022,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HD105591,R61,False,PreVAIL kIds,1R61HD105591-01,phs002945.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): A Data Science Approach to Identify and Manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Kawasaki Disease in Pediatric Patients,COVID-19,"The primary objective of this study was to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment, and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

Such approaches will help properly tailor his or her management and optimize health outcomes./nThe funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nBackground/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Given this, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx program is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies. /nAs a part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this RFA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nProject Details/nDespite substantial numbers of children becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 globally, most have had mild COVID-19 clinical illness unless co-morbidities were present. Initially, the risk of severe disease or mortality was thought to be a concern exclusively for adults and the elderly. However, within the past 3 months, reports from Europe and the US of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure and/or infection of varying severity, including shock and death, have increased attention to the varied pediatric manifestations of the infection and its post-infectious complications. Significantly, MIS-C occurs in previously healthy children who may have initially had only mild manifestations or no symptoms at all. In addition, an increase in the number of cases of Kawasaki Disease (KD) has occurred and is thought to also be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Typical KD, which occurs many-fold more often in Japan than in the US, has been known for decades. Its underlying mechanism is unknown, but it has been suspected that an as of yet unidentified  immune trigger  leads to the phenotype. Variability in clinical presentation and overlap with a continuum of other disease manifestations have hindered robust investigations into its immunopathogenesis, preventing identification of reliable and accurate diagnostic and other markers of disease severity and progression. The milder presentation of SARS-CoV-2 in children characterized by minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic disease is particularly challenging and further complicates prompt identification of children who may progress to the more severe cascade of post-infectious inflammation-mediated organ damage and dysfunction representative of MIS-C./nThe new working case definition of MIS-C from the CDC is 1) An individual aged < 21 years presenting with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem (=2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, GI, dermatologic, or neurological; 2) No alternative plausible diagnoses; 3) Positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test; or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case within 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. Thus, to answer whether there is a spectrum of disease that may be potentiated or separately provoked by SARS-CoV-2   that is, SARS-CoV-2 immune-mediated fever with cytokine release versus SARS-CoV-2 triggered KD or, SARS-CoV-2 triggered shock - it is imperative to swiftly characterize that spectrum and robustly inform the clinical and research community whether and how to diagnose and to predict the risk of MIS-C./nWhile research findings on COVID-19 have yielded important new scientific information with unprecedented reach and expedience, fundamental questions remain unanswered about the natural history and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children that may help provide important clues on host-pathogen interactions with potential prognostic power to predict optimal outcomes /nTo address these and other vital questions in this emerging and potentially devastating health threat among children, there is a critical and urgent need to develop novel, new or unique and non-traditional approaches to 1) characterize the spectrum of SARS CoV-2 associated illness in children, including MIS-C, and 2) identify and validate biomarkers and/or biosignatures for a prognostic algorithm to predict the longitudinal risk of disease severity after a child is exposed to and may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 to properly tailor his or her management and optimize health outcomes. Such prognostic approaches would bring an evidence base to inform decisions about safely operating schools./nResearch Objectives and Scope/nThis initiative intends to focus on novel, nontraditional approaches to find cases of SARS-CoV-2 associated illness in children to promptly address the emerging health threat posed by MIS-C and will require access to well-characterized cohorts of children along the spectrum of SARS CoV-2 associated illness, including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and to their biospecimens and data. To be successful, the development of such approaches must be multifaceted and include novel testing strategies and technologies (e.g. diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and/or biosignatures), used alone or in combination (e.g. artificial intelligence [AI]-based algorithms) to rapidly diagnose and characterize MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 and to accurately risk-stratify and predict disease severity throughout exposure and/or infection and throughout the course of illness. Ideal approaches will also include a longer-term vision of advancing the development of assays, technologies and strategies that are Real-time connected, Easy to collect specimens, Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid, Equipment-free and Delivered to children who need them (REASSURED). Collectively, these will accomplish the following overarching research objectives /nThese approaches, strategies and technologies that may lead to an accurate, reliable and validated MIS-C prognostic algorithm to enhance the treatment of children must ideally include all or as many of the following areas, as possible /n1. Genetics, Omics and Other Biomarkers /nA variety of host and pathogen-specific characteristics have been associated with COVID-19 related health outcomes, including HLA, ABO blood groups, H antigen secretor status, serum proteins, lipids and metabolites, and virus clades and subtypes. Additionally, immunologic characteristics recently identified among COVID-19 patients suggest biophysiological perturbations not only from associated immune activation and dysregulation, but also from potential viral-mediated immunosuppression. Effects from perturbations can manifest not only systemically, but also locally at mucosal tissues necessitating a strategic approach to sample collection and analysis including saliva, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, stool, blood, plasma, serum, urine, and/or sweat. Strategies for identifying a prognostic biomarker signature could include various  omics  platforms including but not limited to genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can be employed to screen and identify candidate biosignatures diagnostic of MIS-C and with prognostic potential that will then need to be validated./n2. Viral Dynamics and Immune Profiling Studies/nAdvances in rapid point-of-care testing have demonstrated the capacity for portable and inexpensive diagnostics for viral infections. The rapidly evolving fields of molecular diagnostics, biotechnology, synthetic biology and other related research areas will be useful in developing innovative approaches that allow direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a self-testing platform. Similarly, innovative self-testing approaches may facilitate the identification of an early and evolving immune response to the virus and determine potential immune correlates of protection, especially among minimally symptomatic children with COVID-19 or among asymptomatic carriers. Finally, a combination of novel direct antigen and antibody detection strategies will be needed to comprehensively characterize the trajectory of viral shedding and inform risk of onward transmission events and characterize the immunopathogenesis throughout the spectrum of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to acute and convalescent infection in infants, children and adolescents. Sample collection and analysis here may similarly require saliva, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, stool, blood, plasma, serum, urine, and/or sweat./n3. Digital Health Platforms Leveraged for Children/nThe rapid proliferation of data science technologies and platforms in helping focus and implement successful COVID-19 containment and mitigation strategies can be leveraged to inform risk profiles that may have diagnostic and prognostic potential for children with MIS-C. Biosensors incorporated with mobile technology and access to pediatric EHRs could help correlate data and assess temporal relationships. Cloud computing can be implemented for storage and analysis, sharing with local health agencies to track cases of MIS-C./n4. Artificial Intelligence Platforms/nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can be leveraged to integrate and analyze data in real-time and facilitate the identification of a biosignature with prognostic potential to establish reliable algorithms for characterization of MIS-C and predicting severe disease outcomes. To accomplish this, strategies will be needed that employ deep learning to expeditiously interrogate a variety of data sets (e.g. signs and symptoms, physical findings, diagnoses, laboratory, radiology and other images, and mobile health data, etc.) to recognize, identify and iteratively analyze specific patterns of disease presentations or manifestations of MIS-C. AI algorithms can diagnose and help tailor medical care and treatment plans to optimize pediatric health outcomes in MIS-C and can be validated in clinical trials or through other methods./nDevelopment of such technologies is expected to require collaboration among experts in the fields of virology, biotechnology (e.g., microfluidics, bioengineering, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and/or manufacturing) and bioinformatics, as well social and behavioral science. While a main focus of the studies should be on biomarkers and signatures of MIS-C, ancillary studies related to development and integration of technologies for sample preparation and/or sample readout are also expected. Applicants who include a consultation milestone with FDA to pursue Pre-EUA and EUA request mechanisms for novel coronavirus test development at an appropriate time during either the R61 or R33 phase, depending on the stage of project will receive high program priority. Applicants are not required to consult with the FDA during the R61 phase but are encouraged to include a consultation as one of their R61 milestones if the project is sufficiently advanced that an EUA request is expected during the R33 phase. /nResearch activities from this initiative will complement other NIH-wide initiatives to address a critical knowledge gap about the contributing factors associated with increased susceptibility to MIS-C and how these data can be used in real-time to implement risk-stratified management strategies. This initiative also intends to leverage relevant innovations from other NIH Institutes (e.g. NIBIBâ€™s POCTRN), and research platforms supporting well-characterized cohorts of children along the spectrum of SARS CoV-2 associated illness, including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and their biospecimens and data, as appropriate. Such cohorts may be available through the NIH RADx-UP-funded [NOT-OD-20-121] large-scale networks, consortia and centers focused on COVID-19 testing in underserved and vulnerable children and adolescents and/or other NIH-funded networks and studies focused on MIS-C and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications in children./nInternational research partners may be eligible for inclusion, if appropriate, to increase the sample size and participant diversity, which affects the host genome, genetic factors that involve the immune system, environmental and sociocultural factors, and other co-factors. In addition, NIH intramural investigators would be eligible and encouraged to contribute relevant expertise and resources to synergize with this program./nApplications nonresponsive to terms of this RFA will be withdrawn without review. The following types of projects would generally not be appropriate and may be deemed non-responsive /nPhased Innovation Awards/nThis funding opportunity will use the R61/R33 phased award mechanism. Support will be provided for up to two years for the R61 phase, and up to two additional years of support may follow for the R33 phase./nThe R61 phase is for high-risk, high-impact, milestone-driven exploratory/feasibility studies. Preliminary data are not required for the R61 phase. However, appropriate theoretical justification and hypotheses should be provided as evidence that the proposed project is feasible and well-designed for the intended purpose. The use of milestones for the R61 phase will guide the potential transition to the R33 phase./nThe R33 phase is for expanded discovery and development of biomarkers and/or biosignatures, such as optimization of performance specifications and validation testing of prognostic algorithms against appropriate comparison conditions./nApplications should include research plans and budgets for both the R61 and R33 phases. The clarity and completeness of the R61/R33 application, including specific goals and Transition Milestones, are critical.

These materials will be evaluated by NIH Program staff. Programs that consult with the FDA prior to the transition review will receive high program priority at the transition. Transition to the R33 phase is neither automatic nor guaranteed; funding decisions will be based on the successful completion of pre-defined milestones, program priorities, and availability of funds. Grants selected for continued funding will be transitioned to an R33 award without the need to submit a new application/nLeveraging Existing Research Resources  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies whenever possible.

Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation./nFor this particular announcement, note the following /nThe R61/R33 phased innovation grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new interventions, model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical research. An R61/R33 grant application need not have preliminary data, extensive background material or preliminary information; however, they may be included if available. Appropriate theoretical justification and hypotheses for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data, as evidence that the proposed project is feasible and well-designed for the intended purpose. The use of specific, quantifiable, scientifically rigorous milestones for the R61 phase will guide the potential transition to the R33 phase. The R33 phase is for expanded discovery and development, such as optimization of performance specifications and validation testing, with appropriate comparison condition. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Reviewers will assign a single impact score for the entire application, which includes both the R61 and R33 phases./nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed)./nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each.
