Although cancer can be diagnosed following tissue biopsy, the biopsy procedure is invasive; liquid biopsy provides an alternative that is more comfortable for the patient. While blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid can all be used as a source of liquid biopsy, saliva is an ideal source of body fluid that is readily available and easily collected in the most noninvasive manner. Characterization of salivary constituents in the disease setting provides critical data for understanding pathophysiology and the evaluation of diagnostic potential. The aim of saliva diagnostics is therefore to develop a rapid and noninvasive detection of oral and systemic diseases that could be used together with compact analysis systems in the clinic to facilitate point-of-care diagnostics.","Biomarkers, Tumor|Early Detection of Cancer|Humans|Liquid Biopsy|Neoplasms|Saliva|circulating biomarkers|saliva exosomics|saliva liquid biopsy|salivaomics|salivary exosomes","Nonaka, Taichiro|Wong, David T W","Annual review of analytical chemistry (Palo Alto, Calif.)",2022,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review",TR003778,U18,False,Exosome,1U18TR003778-01,phs002544.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): AFS/SERS Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Earliest Infection and Antibodies Detection,COVID-19,"This U18 application is responsive to the NIH's RADx-rad Emergency Response to the COVID-pandemic for new or non-traditional technologies developed to single extracellular vesicle, exosome and extracellular RNA (exRNA) isolation and analysis and reposition them for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

This emergency FOA provides an expedited funding mechanism as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. Specifically, this FOA seeks to use technologies developed for single extracellular vesicle, exosome, and extracellular RNA (exRNA) isolation and analysis and reposition them for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nBackground/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Thus,, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx initiative is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring forward their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs a part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents. /nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this RFA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this FOA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nA trans-NIH working group is making existing COVID-19 survey items and investigator contact information publicly available through two NIH-supported platforms  the NIH Public Health Emergency and Disaster Research Response (DR2) and the PhenX Toolkit. Researchers addressing COVID-19 questions, whether population-based or for clinical research, are strongly encouraged to consider these COVID-19 specific survey item repositories and select existing survey items or protocol modules currently being fielded./nMany NIH programs such as the Extracellular RNA Communication (ERC) program (supported by the NIH Common Fund) and the Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program (supported by NCI), seek to understand exRNA biology and accelerate development of exRNAs and exosomes as potential therapeutics and diagnostics through the development of novel tools and technologies. Exosomes are a subpopulation of EVs that present the biggest challenge as their small size is a current technical limitation for most isolation and analysis technologies. Under these programs, novel methods for single extracellular vesicle and exosome isolation have been developed. These exosome-based technologies also have the capacity to analyze exRNAs present in single EVs. The current SARS-CoV-2 virus has similar physical and chemical properties as EVs and exosomes. SARS-CoV-2 virions are the same size as exosomes and contain a single-stranded RNA viral genome that can be utilized for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Since exosomes resemble many viruses both structurally and functionally, these novel tools and technologies, developed under ERC program for example, may prove to be invaluable in screening for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19, as they were designed for the isolation, detection, and analysis of single vesicles and will inherently have the specificity and sensitivity to detect low viral titer. This FOA seeks new ways to identify the current SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as potential new and emerging viruses using newly developed technologies for single extracellular vesicle, exosome, and exRNA isolation and analysis that can be deployed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Awards funded under this FOA are required to involve activities conducted by multi-disciplinary teams of investigators with the goal of developing novel technologies for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as potential new and emerging viruses./nNATURE OF THE RESEARCH/nNewly developed technologies for single vesicle, exosome, and exRNA isolation and analyses will be repositioned for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that has similar physical and chemical properties as exosomes. These technologies will utilize non-invasive, point-of-care sample collection from body fluids to develop non-invasive, reliable, and reproducible COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Applications should state how the proposed SARS-CoV-2 isolation and detection strategy will improve upon current COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Support will be provided for up to two years for the initial proof of concept studies./nLeveraging Existing Research Resources  /nApplicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies whenever possible. NIH has developed innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality, and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public through programs such as  NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hubs (REACH), and Small Business Education and Entrepreneurial Development (SEED) for commercialization of final products. Applicants are encouraged to leverage all available internal (e.g., home institutional) and external (e.g., external institutional, NIH, and/or NCATS) resources to identify clinically relevant COVID-19 populations./nSpecific Research Objectives/nActivities will include, but are not limited to /nActivities will include, but are not limited to /nNCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) hubs can be used in the clinical validation for recruitment and trial implementation (https //ncats.nih.gov/ctsa/about/hubs)./nActivities will include, but are not limited to /n The DCC and designated NIH databases will be utilized for the banking and distribution of biological and clinical data.Project PD(s)/PI(s) will be expected to harmonize all data and resource generation with the DCC.

NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices

",4,"The publication abstract is related to the research objectives of the funding opportunity and the grant abstract, as it discusses the use of saliva as a non-invasive source for diagnostics, which aligns with the goal of the RADx-rad initiative to develop non-invasive, reliable, and reproducible COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Although the publication abstract focuses on cancer diagnostics, the concept of using saliva for non-invasive diagnostics can be applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as mentioned in the grant abstract. The publication abstract provides a foundation for understanding the potential of saliva diagnostics, which can be leveraged for COVID-19 detection, making it relevant to the research objectives of the funding opportunity and the grant abstract.",Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct,11130,160,16.5,0.0
