40390292,PMC12163592,doi:10.1093/chemse/bjaf015,"Towards universal chemosensory testing: needs, barriers, and opportunities.","Millions of people in the United States experience a reduced or distorted ability to smell or taste. Chemosensory disorders such as anosmia (the inability to smell), parosmia (distorted smell), or dysgeusia (altered taste) have major impacts on health and quality of life including difficulty sensing dangers such as fire or spoilage, a diminished palatability of food and drink that can negatively influence diet and nutrition, feelings of social isolation, and an increased incidence of frailty, anxiety, and depression. Smell or taste dysfunction can also be symptoms of other health issues, including sinonasal disease, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease. Aging adults are disproportionately affected. However, smell and taste function are not regularly assessed as a part of routine healthcare despite their prevalence and impact. This is a lost opportunity, as early detection of a chemosensory disorder would enable patients to obtain needed validation, education and support for their health challenge, could direct both patient and provider to treatment options, and may suggest underlying health issues that should be addressed. To better understand the current barriers to including chemosensory testing as a regular component of health care and to identify opportunities to overcome those barriers, the conference ""Towards Universal Chemosensory Testing"" was convened on November 5-7, 2023, in Philadelphia, PA. This conference brought together scientists, clinicians, patients, and other experts to discuss these issues and identify collective ways to overcome barriers to testing. This white paper-which is focused primarily on the US healthcare system-is the result of those discussions.",Humans|Olfaction Disorders|Smell|Taste Disorders|anosmia|clinical|dysgeusia|hyposmia|smell|taste,"Munger, Steven D|Zhao, Kai|Barlow, Linda A|Boak, Duncan|Boateng, Katie|Coldwell, Susan E|Dalton, Pamela|Doty, Richard L|Douglas, Jennifer E|Duffy, Valerie|Franklin, Frank A|Hayes, John E|Hoffman, Howard J|Hubert, Patrice|Joseph, Paule V|Justice, Jeb M|Levy, Joshua M|Mennella, Julie A|Obrist, Marianna|Pepino, M Yanina|Pinto, Jayant M|Pribitkin, Edmund A|Simons, Christopher T|Albers, Mark W|Parma, Valentina",Chemical senses,2025,Journal Article|Review,DC019573,U01,False,Chemosensory Testing,1U01DC019573-01,phs002631.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Rapid Olfactory Tools for Telemedicine-Friendly COVID-19 Screening and Survey,COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating infectious disease outbreak in a century, particularly in underserved and minoritized communities. In 2020 alone, it costed a million lives. It continues to wreak economic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals who can then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment. Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries, including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timely processing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that can help identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge with symptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean; the heterogeneity of symptoms means that no single symptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that sudden partial or complete olfactory loss, even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough, is the single best predictor of COVID-19. In this proposal, we will develop and implement objective, self-administered smell tests for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as well as for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread. Several kinds of objective tests have been used in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test the ability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration an individual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach has technical and logistical advantages and disadvantages, and each captures different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. Regarding COVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure has the highest specificity or sensitivity. In Aim 1, we will use self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals to determine which olfactory measure is the best predictor of COVID-19. In Aim 2, we will use objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in University, municipal or other community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, our studies will provide a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at the individual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionally underserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.

This emergency FOA from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides an expedited funding mechanism as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. The overall goal of the RADx-rad initiative. Specifically, the goal of this FOA is to solicit applications to enhance the utility of chemosensory testing as a COVID-19 screening tool by using objective tests to examine the onset and prognostic value of chemosensory loss and to encourage the development and/or deployment of home-based and on-site chemosensory tests./nThe funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nBackground/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, chemosensory dysfunction, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Given this, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx program is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs a part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the DCC funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /n Sudden loss of smell or taste  is formally recognized as one of the hallmarks of COVID-19 by the CDC and has emerged as the main neurological manifestation of the disease with as many as 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 reporting chemosensory dysfunction. In fact, recent observational studies indicate that the loss of smell and taste is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 and more predictive than all other symptoms, including fatigue, fever, or cough. Most studies to date have used self-report rather than objective chemosensory testing, leading to the possibility that the prevalence of chemosensory loss may be even higher among patients with COVID-19 than previously reported. These findings highlight the need for objective chemosensory tests for COVID-19 screening, which yield immediate results and are validated across the lifespan, easy to self-administer, and quantitative and graded to allow the determination of diminished as well as profound sensory loss. This initiative aims to support further development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for chemosensory testing to screen patients for COVID-19 and to complement current temperature screening procedures./nResearch Objectives/nThis FOA will fund cooperative agreements to existing NIH awards to support chemosensory testing as a COVID-19 screening tool by using objective tests to examine the onset and prognostic value of chemosensory loss and to encourage the development and/or deployment of home-based and on-site chemosensory tests.

By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain  applicable clinical trials  on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https //register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https //grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm/nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval  Grantee institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols./nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements  The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http //grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398)./nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements  Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).""/nNIH is requiring data sharing for all COVID-19 projects, where it is not prohibited (i.e., Tribal data sovereignty). The NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers to expedite the translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. Grantees are expected to work with the RADx-rad DCC to submit common evaluation metrics on COVID-19 testing-related outcomes and implementation to the DCC. Grantees should identify a dedicated unit responsible for these data reporting activities. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad DCC, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the DCC funding opportunity. To the extent possible, data acquisition, collection, and curation strategies should be coordinated with the DCC guidance for annotation and benchmarking of data, including obtaining appropriate consent for data sharing and implementation of the schemas proposed under the ABOUT ML effort ( Annotation and benchmarking on understanding and transparency for machine learning lifecycles ; available at https //www.partnershiponai.org/about-ml/). Grantees are expected to participate in DCC-organized activities, including regular (e.g., monthly) progress meetings with individual or subsets of awardees, and twice annual meetings with all RADx-rad awardees./nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA.

This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see https //www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http //www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html./nHHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA./nPlease contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https //www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697./nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205  Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.  This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships./nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.

      The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below./nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for /nNIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below /nNIH will assign a Program Official, Project Scientist(s), and a Grants Management Specialist to each award./nNIH Project Scientist(s) will have substantial scientific involvement during the conduct of this activity, through technical assistance, advice, and coordination. The NIH Project Scientist(s) will /nAn NIH Program Official will be responsible for the normal programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. The program official(s) will /nAdditionally, the NIH Program Official(s) may recommend the termination or curtailment of an activity in the event the proposed activities fail to evolve within the intent and purpose of this initiative./nAreas of Joint Responsibility include /nDispute Resolution/nAny disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened, and each member will have one vote. Members will be  a designee of the award governing body chosen without NIH staff input, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16./nFunds awarded using appropriations provided by the  Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, Public Law 116-139  will be issued in unique subaccounts in the HHS Payment Management System and will require separate financial reporting from any other funds awarded./nA final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement./nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreementsare required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. See the NIH Grants Policy Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement./nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.
