33208926,PMC9020268,doi:10.1038/s41551-020-00640-6,Pre-symptomatic detection of COVID-19 from smartwatch data.,"Consumer wearable devices that continuously measure vital signs have been used to monitor the onset of infectious disease. Here, we show that data from consumer smartwatches can be used for the pre-symptomatic detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analysed physiological and activity data from 32 individuals infected with COVID-19, identified from a cohort of nearly 5,300 participants, and found that 26 of them (81%) had alterations in their heart rate, number of daily steps or time asleep. Of the 25 cases of COVID-19 with detected physiological alterations for which we had symptom information, 22 were detected before (or at) symptom onset, with four cases detected at least nine days earlier. Using retrospective smartwatch data, we show that 63% of the COVID-19 cases could have been detected before symptom onset in real time via a two-tiered warning system based on the occurrence of extreme elevations in resting heart rate relative to the individual baseline. Our findings suggest that activity tracking and health monitoring via consumer wearable devices may be used for the large-scale, real-time detection of respiratory infections, often pre-symptomatically.","Adult|Asymptomatic Diseases|COVID-19|Female|Humans|Male|Monitoring, Physiologic|Pandemics|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|Wearable Electronic Devices","Mishra, Tejaswini|Wang, Meng|Metwally, Ahmed A|Bogu, Gireesh K|Brooks, Andrew W|Bahmani, Amir|Alavi, Arash|Celli, Alessandra|Higgs, Emily|Dagan-Rosenfeld, Orit|Fay, Bethany|Kirkpatrick, Susan|Kellogg, Ryan|Gibson, Michelle|Wang, Tao|Hunting, Erika M|Mamic, Petra|Ganz, Ariel B|Rolnik, Benjamin|Li, Xiao|Snyder, Michael P",Nature biomedical engineering,2020,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NR020105,R01,False,Multimodal Surveillance,1R01NR020105-01,phs002523.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring and Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,COVID-19,"We plan to extend and improve our COH/PHD system in using wearables for the early detection of COVID-19 infection.

Projects proposed may use strategies that incorporate ideas and approaches from multiple disciplines, as appropriate./nBackground /nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Given this, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx program is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring their innovative idea for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs a part of this initiative, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) project. RADx-rad will support research and development for new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the DCC funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nSpecific Research Objectives/nThis FOA will focus on developing and validation of approaches that bring together inputs from multiple surveillance technologies, not based or focused on direct viral testing of individuals, to facilitate early detection of COVID-19 in facilities at high risk for infections due to the high density of individuals who stay together for prolonged periods of time (e.g., receiving treatment such as at dialysis centers) or those living together, such as in senior living systems, jails and prisons, residential treatment facilities, halfway houses, Group Homes for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (GHPID), shelters, or similar./nIn public health, critical surveillance systems remain primarily based on manually collected and coded data, often done by healthcare workers. The data are slow to collect and difficult to disseminate or act upon. In the precarious time before a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes widely available, the contagion could be slowed down by rapid identification and isolation of infections. While diagnostic viral testing is a critical tool, it is not readily scalable for ongoing monitoring of asymptomatic individuals. Continuing outbreaks of COVID-19 in communal living settings have demonstrated the capacity of the virus to spread rapidly and widely, aided by the transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals. For example, the high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality observed among residents in long-term care facilities pose a major challenge for disease prevention and control in such settings. Furthermore, the lack of surveillance systems and the differences in testing strategies and capacities among facilities may lead to a significant under-reporting of cases, contributing to a general underestimation of the disease burden and mortality in high density settings. Among the factors that may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within and between long-term care facilities are the shortage of personnel and limiting the testing to symptomatic individuals. The situation is even more complicated in cases when the high prevalence of neurological conditions such as dementia and neuropathic disorders among the residential care facility populations results in atypical COVID-19 clinical presentations or the absence of evident signs or symptoms until the patients  conditions deteriorate. Surveillance can provide the missing link to understanding how an individual infection becomes a transmission event. This capability is crucial during a pandemic where transmission is possible across vulnerable patients. Further, surveillance enables the facility administrators and clinicians to assess their infection control protocols and make changes to improve outcomes in the future./nThus, this FOA seeks research applications expanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies that  will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed surveillance technologies could include digital and algorithmic features, biometric technologies, and internet-based participatory surveillance, but should be adapted to the specific conditions of the high-density circumstances of residential care institutions or medical facilities. The responsive projects would focus on development of robust, local, real-time, accurate and cost-effective surveillance projects that demonstrate innovative integration of technologies. In addition to functional surveillance, these projects may also explore novel methods of data collection and interpretation and use of machine intelligence to facilitate broad-based, real-time assessment, along with data modeling, prediction and visualization (which would require the use of standard vocabulary and common data elements (CDE)), all in the context of addressing the needs of high risk, vulnerable populations. The applicants are encouraged to incorporate partnership with at least one category of at-risk institutions or facilities (e.g., senior living systems, jails and prisons, residential treatment facilities, dialysis units) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel surveillance approaches in a real-world setting./nIt is important that the applicants present a clear and well-formulated vision for the use of surveillance technology, which is understood and supported by all stakeholders, to assure successful implementation. The applicants are encouraged to consider designs that would keep the additional workload for the facilities  staff to a minimum by making an attempt to incorporate surveillance technology into existing care routines./nThe proposed systems should also be designed with special focus on social inclusion, to help overcome social barriers and digital marginalization (e.g. due to lack of digital access among residents at long-term care facilities, homeless shelters, etc.)./nThe research questions that could be explored by the applicants to this FOA include, but are not limited to /nProjects that do not have an infrastructure to rapidly report study findings and impact to the DCC are non-responsive and will be withdrawn without review./nSpecific Areas of Research Interest from the participating NIH ICs of this FOA are listed below. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts from various NIH ICs listed in Section VII prior to submission to discuss IC program relevance./nNational institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)/nNIDA has previously supported several surveillance technologies initially intended for drug and overdose detection that could be amenable for real-time, spatially selective, early detection of COVID-19. NIDA is interested in adapting the technologies to the current needs of the communities struggling with the substance use disorders (SUD) that are disproportionally affected by COVID-19, including residents of in-patient SUD treatment facilities. Despite the recent favorable changes in some policies related to the outpatient vs. inpatient treatment options, for many SUD patients the outpatient measures are not considered an adequate clinical option (e.g. life-threatening situations for people at high risk for overdose or complications from withdrawal). Inpatient/residential programs that need to remain open during the current COVID-19 related emergency have been advised to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on precautions in admitting new patients, management of current residents who may have been exposed to or who are infected with COVID-19, and visitor policies. NIDA is particularly interested in surveillance platforms that would specifically address the needs of the SUD inpatient/residential programs with the focus on admitting new patients during the pandemic and providing uninterrupted services to the current residents./nNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)/nNIDCR is interested in multimodal surveillance platforms that could be utilized in dental settings to allow for informed decision-making regarding provision of dental care to ensure the safety of patients and dental personnel./nNIDCR is also interested in multimodal surveillance platforms that apply oral biosensing technologies intended for non-invasive, real-time, early detection of COVID-19 from a variety of biomolecular, chemical and physical markers in oral and nasal cavities. These technologies would use objective measures to examine the prevalence, onset, and trends of COVID-19 positivity in the settings in which they are deployed./nNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)/nThe NIMHD is interested in the development of surveillance systems that operate at multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal/organizational, neighborhood/community, and societal). See the NIMHD Research Framework, https //www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information. The research must focus on one or more minority or health disparity populations (African Americans/Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority populations)./nNational Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)/nThe NINR supports research that can build the scientific foundation for clinical practice, prevent disease and disability, manage and eliminate symptoms caused by illness, and enhance end-of-life and palliative care, and actively supports research on health disparities, communication and literacy. For this initiative, NINR is interested in how multimodal testing systems will be understood, perceived and adopted by the participant community and their families or caretakers, with a special focus on strategies to enhance acceptance by health disparity populations./nNational Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)/nNIGMS is interested in the development of computational, statistical, and mathematical models and the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning for COVID-19 surveillance./nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)/nDialysis units serve a patient population that is at high risk for complications from COVID-19 due to age and multiple comorbidities. In addition, most outpatient hemodialysis in the US (>85%, about 450,000 prevalent patients) is administered through  in-center  hemodialysis. Thus, despite the outpatient nature of this care, patients and providers cannot quickly convert to home therapy. That said, hemodialysis units have a highly trained workforce which has experience in infection control and such routine practices may favorably impact transmission of the virus. NIDDK is interested in multimodal surveillance platforms that would specifically address the needs of patients and staff in hemodialysis units, including but not limited to admitting new patients during the pandemic, providing uninterrupted services to the current patients, and allowing for informed decision-making regarding provision of dialysis care to ensure the safety of patients and dialysis unit staff/nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)/nOff-premise alcohol outlets, including bars and restaurants, are potential hotspots for the transmission of COVID-19. Similarly, in-patient treatment facilities, sober living facilities, and in-person mutual support groups also represent opportunities for the spread of infection. Research is needed to understand the behaviors, such as social distancing and mask wearing, of persons in these locations that could influence the risk of disease spread. In the case of bars and restaurants, it would be helpful to understand how alcohol consumption influences behaviors that place patrons at risk. For instance, alcohol reduces social inhibitions and might increase the chances that patrons interact in ways that put them at risk of becoming infected or of spreading the virus (e.g., reduced social distancing or mask wearing). It would be beneficial for public health to conduct novel research using multimodal surveillance strategies to assess how patronage at bars during the pandemic impacts the risk of contracting COVID-19, whether there are particular strategies employed at some bars that minimize the risk, and how alcohol consumption impacts behavior in ways that increase or decrease the risk. It would also be helpful to know how the pandemic has impacted group interactions at residential treatment facilities, sober living facilities and mutual support groups, and whether certain therapeutic approaches, such as group sessions, place individuals at a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. Such studies could provide useful information for developing strategies to reduce the risk of infection at these locations./nNational Library of Medicine (NLM)/nNLM is interested in novel computational and statistical methods to enhance discovery in large or merged health data sets with a focus on understanding and characterizing the gaps, errors, biases, and other limitations in the data or in inferences based on the data; exploring approaches to correct biases or compensate for missing data, including the introduction of debiasing techniques and policies or the use of synthetic data; improving approaches for integrating, mining, and analyzing health data that preserve the confidentiality, accuracy, completeness and overall security of the data, including ethical issues that might arise from a proposed approach./nLeveraging Existing Research Resources  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies whenever possible. NIH has developed innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality, and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public through programs such as  NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hubs (REACH), Small Business Education and Entrepreneurial Development (SEED) for assistance in proof of concept and commercialization of a marketable product. Applicants are encouraged to leverage all available internal (e.g., home institutional) and external (e.g., external institutional, NIH, and/or NIDCR and NCATS) resources to identify clinically relevant COVID-19 patient populations./nSee Section VIII.

NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices

",5,"The publication abstract directly addresses the research objectives of the funding opportunity and the grant abstract. The funding opportunity focuses on developing and validating COVID-19 surveillance methods, particularly in high-density settings, using multimodal surveillance inputs. The grant abstract proposes a project that extends and improves a system for early detection of COVID-19 infection using wearables, aiming to optimize algorithms for diverse ethnic backgrounds, integrate systems for real-time detection, and deploy the system in concentrated populations. The publication abstract presents a study that uses smartwatch data for pre-symptomatic detection of COVID-19, showing that physiological and activity data can be used to detect COVID-19 before symptom onset. This aligns with the grant's objectives and the funding opportunity's goals, demonstrating a strong connection between the publication and the research objectives outlined in both the funding opportunity and the grant abstract.",Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct,13968,185,16.3,0.0
