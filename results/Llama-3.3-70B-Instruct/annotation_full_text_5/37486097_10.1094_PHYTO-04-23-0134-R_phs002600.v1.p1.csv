37486097,PMC11014742,doi:10.1094/PHYTO-04-23-0134-R,A Metabolomics Assay to Diagnose Citrus Huanglongbing Disease and to Aid in Assessment of Treatments to Prevent or Cure Infection.,"Citrus greening disease, or Huanglongbing (HLB), has devastated citrus crops globally in recent years. The causal bacterium, '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus', presents a sampling issue for qPCR diagnostics and results in a high false negative rate. In this work, we compared six metabolomics assays to identify HLB-infected citrus trees from leaf tissue extracted from 30 control and 30 HLB-infected trees. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based assay was most accurate. A final partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was trained and validated on 690 leaf samples with corresponding qPCR measures from three citrus varieties (Rio Red grapefruit, Hamlin sweet orange, and Valencia sweet orange) from orchards in Florida and Texas. Trees were naturally infected with HLB transmitted by the insect vector <i>Diaphorina citri</i>. In a randomized validation set, the assay was 99.9% accurate to classify diseased from nondiseased samples. This model was applied to samples from trees receiving plant defense-inducer compounds or biological treatments to prevent or cure HLB infection. From two trials, HLB-related metabolite abundances and PLS-DA scores were tracked longitudinally and compared with those of control trees. We demonstrate how our assay can assess tree health and the efficacy of HLB treatments and conclude that no trialed treatment was efficacious.",Citrus|Citrus sinensis|Hemiptera|Liberibacter|Plant Diseases|Rhizobiaceae|Trees|citrus|huanglongbing|mass spectrometry|metabolomics|plant diagnostics,"McCartney, Mitchell M|Eze, Michael O|Borras, Eva|Edenfield, Michael|Batuman, Ozgur|Manker, Denise C|da Graça, John V|Ebeler, Susan E|Davis, Cristina E",Phytopathology,2024,Journal Article,TR003795,U18,False,SCENT,1U18TR003795-01,phs002600.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Portable GC Detector for COVID Diagnostics,COVID-19,"The data herein combines GC-MS and GC-DMS analysis of exhaled breath vapor compounds.

This emergency FOA provides an expedited funding mechanism as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. /nSpecifically, this FOA is seeking applications for a portable sensing device to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs, i.e., scents or odors) emanating from skin or exhaled breath, saliva and different oral tissues from the oral cavity. These sensing devices must be able to associate VOC patterns to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19. These devices are expected to actively detect VOCs from skin and oral cavities of COVID-19 patients, without being invasive, or affecting the integrity of the skin and oral cavity. For VOC monitoring, these sensing devices can be Electronic-nose (E-nose) technology or Gas Chromatography (GC). Therefore, this program is called SCENT, which stands for Screening for COVID-19 by Electronic-Nose Technology. This FOA seeks to advance novel biosensing technologies that are innovative, safe, and effective using integrated artificial intelligent, pattern recognition and machine learning systems that would make it possible for the detection, diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring of COVID-19 in clinical, community and everyday settings./nThis FOA requires multidisciplinary collaborations to ensure project success. Disciplines may include  biomedical engineers, material scientists, biosensing experts, software engineers, chemists, dentists, clinicians, virologists, clinical trialists, biostatisticians, data analysts and/or other relevant experts in academia and industry./nThe funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./n/nAugust 18, 2020/nSeptember 18, 2020/n /nNo late applications will be accepted for this Funding Opportunity Announcement./nAll applications are due by 5 00 PM local time of applicant organization.

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions./nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review./nPurpose/nNIH is issuing this FOA in response to the declared public health emergency issued by the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This emergency cooperative agreement funding opportunity announcement (FOA) provides an expedited funding mechanism as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Radical (RADx-rad) Initiative. The goal of RADx-rad is to solicit proposals for the development of novel, nontraditional approaches to identify the current SARS-C oV-2 virus or other markers of the COVID-19 disease that can be used in future outbreaks of COVID-19 and that could be applicable to other, as yet unknown, viruses. Specifically, this FOA seeks to fund a single cooperative agreement for a RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) to serve as a communication center and data hub for RADx-rad awardees. The funding for this award is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nSpecifically, this initiative seeks to advance the development of novel, safe and effective biosensing and detection technologies for volatile organic compound (VOC) signatures of COVID-19 from human skin or the oral cavity. To this end, leveraging dedicated engineering and artificial intelligence systems is required. This initiative anticipates the implementation of such technologies in everyday settings and routines for detection, diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring of COVID-19 in clinical, community or applied settings. It is envisioned that these technologies will complement traditional virus and antibody detection to monitor the onset, progression, and resolution of COVID-19./nBecause of the short program timeline, Quality by Design (QbD) principles must be leveraged in early research and development of SCENT technologies. A holistic strategy that accounts for end-state manufacturing, production, and usability is expected. Early identification of critical product attributes (e.g., comparable accuracy with the current standard, safety, portability, etc.) and process parameters (e.g., ruggedness of materials used in the device, but also built-in process analytical technologies to ensure acceptable device function) are required. Design of experiment (DoE) techniques is essential. These preclinical development strategies will increase the likelihood of success in meeting eventual clinical performance requirements./nThe funding for this initiative is provided from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 2020./nBackground/nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks. Thus, there is an urgent public health need for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the development of a variety of approaches to testing./nExpanding the capacity, throughput, and regional placement of existing technologies and accelerating the development of new technologies will contribute significantly to the current national efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. To help meet this need, NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing. The RADx initiative is a national call for scientists and organizations to bring forward their innovative ideas for new COVID-19 testing approaches and strategies./nAs a part of this program, the NIH developed the RADx Radical (RADx-rad) initiative. RADx-rad will support new, or non-traditional applications of existing approaches, to enhance their usability, accessibility, and/or accuracy. RADx-rad will be centrally aligned and coordinated to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, providing an opportunity to further explore and identify additional approaches to understand this novel virus. Beyond the current crisis, it is anticipated that the technologies advanced through RADx-rad may also be applicable to other, yet unknown, infectious agents./nTo centrally align and coordinate RADx-rad projects to harmonize the data collection, storage, and management, the Data Coordination Center (DCC) will be established to serve as the  hub  in a hub-and spoke organizational framework within the funded RADx-rad research and development projects serving as spokes. In turn, the DCC will serve as a spoke in the larger NIH RADx initiative by providing de-identified data to an NIH-based data hub. NIH expects that all projects funded under this FOA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. The RADx-rad DCC will provide support and guidance to RADx-rad awardees in the following three areas  (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics, (2) Data Collection, Integration and Sharing, and (3) Data Management and Use. The DCC will develop (and revise as necessary) a framework for standards, metadata and common data elements that apply to all types of data gathered by RADx-rad awardees in order to maximize potential for longitudinal research, integration with other RADx data, and for evaluation of RADx-rad program impact. The DCC will assist awardees in identifying and obtaining data from public sources (e.g., Census data, Area Deprivation Index, etc.), electronic health records (EHR), administrative data, and others as needed. The DCC will coordinate quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provide tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated data. The DCC will create a mechanism to support harmonizing with other large-scale COVID-19 research efforts and will participate in trans-NIH efforts to support scientific collaboration and data-sharing, evaluation of progress towards sustainable infrastructure, partnership and rapid dissemination of RADx findings./nNIH requires that all projects funded under this RFA will actively coordinate, collaborate, and share data with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center, as allowed, and with considerations under tribal IRB processes, as appropriate. Researchers applying to this funding opportunity are strongly encouraged to review the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) funding opportunity (RFA-OD-20-019)./nTo maximize research and rapidly implement approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons across datasets or studies and data integration are essential to collaboration. Projects funded through this RFA are strongly encouraged to use the following resources as applicable /nLeveraging Existing Research Resources  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies whenever possible. NIH has developed innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality, and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public through programs such as  NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hubs (REACH), Small Business Education and Entrepreneurial Development (SEED) for assistance in proof of concept and commercialization of a marketable product. Applicants are encouraged to leverage all available internal (e.g., home institutional) and external (e.g., external institutional, NIH, and/or NIDCR and NCATS) resources to identify clinically relevant COVID-19 patient populations./nSCENT  With the tentative opening of many States came an increase in COVID-19 cases, thus, there is a critical need for non-traditional testing technologies that are non-invasive, not reagent intensive, and that do not take a long time to gather results. It is highly desirable for an accurate and sensitive system that can provide results in real time and is mobile/portable and deployable in any clinical, community and everyday setting. Current testing technologies are not practical for field use, requiring expensive reagents and enzymes and laboratories certified for potentially virulent samples. These tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps and hours, if not days, to get results./nThe SCENT device is envisioned to be used in a hospital, clinic setting, community or even home and workplace. For example, instead of taking temperatures at entrances to establishments, SCENT can be used for more informative and accurate data. The danger of contamination is minimal as SCENT will probe the skin with minimal to no potential exposure to the virus. In addition, the key substrate for SCENT will be VOCs, i.e., scents or odors emanating through skin, which are easier to standardize with, at least, two ways to account for person-to-person differences in skin permeability, namely Total Evaporative Water Loss (TEWL) or skin impedance./nThe oral cavity provides another alternative for SCENT VOC detection because it is readily accessible. For example, exhaled breath could be captured and analyzed for direct detection of the respiratory tract infection from unique volatile organic metabolite byproducts of SARS-CoV2 infection./nVOCs from skin and oral cavity offer opportunities for continuous (i.e., wearable) or periodic monitoring of viral infection and disease presentation. The recent advances in biosensing, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology combined with artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning and smart phone technologies could make such a portable, multifunction device a reality. The innovation/challenge is to combine these technologies into devices that measure VOCs on skin and/or oral cavity, subsequently correlating those VOC patterns with COVID-19 signatures through AI/machine learning. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, this quick screening device would enable doctors to detect and diagnose COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals leading to appropriate treatment and/or quarantine procedures. Additionally, a SCENT platform may be able to differentiate between COVID-negative and COVID-positive-asymptomatic subjects. At the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, dogs are being trained to detect the scent of potential COVID-19 patients. This is possible because the dog’s olfactory system contains 300 million receptors whereas the human nose has only 5 million receptors./nThe central premise of this FOA is to mimic the biological sense of smell with a more robust, standardized and mechanized electronic nose. For example, unique VOC skin signatures are already identified in symptomatic and asymptomatic malarial infections vs. uninfected cases. In the long run, the SCENT platforms are not limited to COVID-19 diagnosis, and can be readily adapted to other pandemics, as well as for the detection of other diseases and conditions. The potential is limited only by the development and availability of the training and validation data sets for VOC signatures that will be used for the machine learning competency./nU18 Milestones  All projects will be milestone-driven with clear go/no-go criteria that are quantifiable. Prior to funding an application, the Program Official will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed U18 milestones and any changes suggested by NIH staff or the NIH review panel. The Program Official and the applicant will negotiate and agree on a final set of approved U18 milestones which will be specified in the Notice of Award. These milestones will be the basis for judging progress and the successful completion of the work proposed./nSpecific Research Objectives/nScanning for COVID-19 with Electronic Nose Technology (SCENT)/nA systems approach must be applied to product development and preclinical performance testing of the proposed device to establish a robust proof-of-concept feasibility./nThe VOC skin sampler can be a simple cup where the VOCs emanating from skin are delivered to the e-Nose or GC column via nitrogen gas or other nonreactive gas, or it can be slightly more sophisticated as in solid-phase microextraction (SPME) where the gases are adsorbed on a material and desorbed into the e-Nose or GC column. The skin VOC sampling system will be developed through testing and optimization of potential designs preferably by Design of Experiments (DoE). The sampling system(s) will have to be validated against known mixtures of VOCs with and without in vitro skin models. Other novel skin sampling designs are encouraged./nFor the oral cavity sampler, the oral environment presents specific design and performance requirements for VOC sampling that need to be addressed. Therefore, a system’s engineering approach must address major challenges imposed by the oral environment including, varying pH levels and temperatures, oral flora, adhesion to wet intraoral tissues, and material biocompatibility/biofouling./nThe sampler for VOCs in the oral cavity can be a blow tube for breath and/or particulates/droplets. However, prevention of infection/contamination of the healthcare worker must be built-in into the design. The sampler can also be an oral probe (analogous to an oral thermometer) placed in contact with oral tissues (e.g., under the tongue) to collect VOCs emanating to the tissue surface. Alternatively, VOCs can be collected from the head space of saliva collected in a closed container. This is a standard procedure that has been applied to VOC analysis of urine. As in the skin sampler, other novel sampling designs for the oral cavity are encouraged./nThe E-Nose is generally an array of a number of materials including conducting polymers, quartz crystal microbalances, fluorescence sensors, semi-conducting metal oxides, etc. The collective signals are processed in an artificial neural network and pattern recognition software. For GC the detector can be a mass spectrometer (MS) or flame ionization detector (FID). Identification of the VOC components by comparison to an MS data base is desirable; however, the pattern recognition is more important. Deposition of data/learning sets into the DCC is required./nThe portable E-nose or GC instrumentation and detector/s will be integrated with the VOC sampler. For off-the-shelf components, compatibility of software must be considered even before assembly of the SCENT platform. The prototype has to be validated against the current standard, laboratory-grade, commercially-available GC or E-nose instrumentation (e.g., MEMS, etc.) and tested for sensitivity and accuracy against known mixtures of VOCs./nQuality by Design (QbD) and incorporation of process analytical technologies (PATs) are required and must be prominently described in the application. QbD will allow for ease and precision of future manufacturability and ensure that device to device differences are at a minimum, while adverse events that are of device origin are limited. Process analytical technologies are required for accuracy and precision of measurements between devices and between patients. PATs for devices may include standard VOC mixtures, pressure sensors, etc. PATs for patient to patient standardization must include skin temperature sensors, skin permeability sensors (e.g., Transepidermal Water Loss [TEWL], skin impedance, etc.) or skin stiffness among others, that can affect the quantity (and perhaps quality) of VOCs sensed by the detectors./nAdoption of human-factors-engineering and usability-engineering principles must be considered during the development process. This includes usability criteria such as comfort to ensure user acceptance and compliance./nAdditionally, VOC sensing approaches for COVID-19 must incorporate design specifications and performance criteria for risk mitigation of potential measurement interferents including, but not limited to  metabolites produced in pathological conditions other than COVID-19; compounds introduced during patient treatment such as drugs, plasma expanders, and anticoagulants; substances ingested by the patient such as alcohol or nutritional supplements. Lastly, the proposed approaches must address other potential causes of examination (analytical) interference, such as  chemical, physical and detection artifacts; non-selectivity and non-specificity of detection; and other sources of error that might affect COVID-19 diagnostics. Risk mitigation and alternative methods are expected./nMost of the technological components required to build these sensing platforms are already developed and used for other purposes. The innovation in this initiative will be the bringing together of expertise in these technologies and coupling with clinical and infectious disease expertise to develop an integrative noninvasive device that will be used specifically for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Future applications of SCENT have potential for monitoring of overall health and detection of other diseases and will be a consideration but not required. The metrics/requirements for successful SCENT are accuracy, sensitivity and selectivity comparable to or exceed current standard, FDA-approved COVID-19 diagnostics. Portability, accessibility, and affordability are also key considerations for SCENT./nSince SCENT can potentially have global applicability and use, it must follow the principles of ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free and deliverable to end users) criteria, outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO), which provides a good framework for evaluating point of care devices specially for resource-limited environments./nUse of commercially available pattern-recognition and machine learning software is allowed and even encouraged in the interest of time. The sensitivity and accuracy of the software must be tested on surrogate samples as in (1) above. In addition, reference/training and validation sets from actual clinical samples in (3) below. will be used to show proof of principle of the machine learning algorithm./nNCATS Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) hubs can be used in the clinical validation for recruitment and trial implementation./nA statistically significant number of patients with known condition(s) are expected to be tested for confident delineation of (1), (2) and (3) based on training sets and comparable accuracy to FDA-approved COVID-19 diagnostics./nApplications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed if /nSee Section VIII.
