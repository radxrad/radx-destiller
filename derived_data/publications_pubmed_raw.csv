39773555,PMC11827850,doi:10.1172/JCI188222,CXCL12 ameliorates neutrophilia and disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers, thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade could be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low-density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2-endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2|Animals|COVID-19|Chemokine CXCL12|Chemokines|Endothelial Cells|Endothelial cells|Female|Humans|Infectious disease|Male|Mice|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Mice, Knockout|Neutrophils|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index","Zheng, Jian|Dhakal, Hima|Qing, Enya|Shrestha, Rejeena|Geller, Anne E|Morrissey, Samantha M|Saxena, Divyasha|Hu, Xiaoling|Li, Hong|Li, Haiyan|Wilhelmsen, Kevin|Wendt, Linder H|Klumpp, Klaus|Hume, Patrick S|Janssen, William J|Brody, Rachel|Palmer, Kenneth E|Uriarte, Silvia M|Ten Eyck, Patrick|Meyerholz, David K|Merchant, Michael L|McLeish, Kenneth|Gallagher, Tom|Huang, Jiapeng|Yan, Jun|Perlman, Stanley",The Journal of clinical investigation,2025,2025-01-07,Journal Article,TR003787,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT
39880798,PMC11800485,doi:10.1093/femsec/fiaf010,Distinct bacteria display genus and species-specific associations with mycobionts in paramo lichens in Colombia.,"Lichens are complex symbiotic systems where fungi interact with an extracellular arrangement of one or more photosynthetic partners and an indeterminate number of other microbes. Recently, specific lichen-microbial community associations have been proposed. In this study, we aimed to characterize the differences in bacteria associated with closely related lichens, under a defined set of environmental conditions in Colombian paramos. Our goal was to determine if there is a correlation between microbiota and host divergence in lichen species belonging to the genus Sticta. We found that specific microbiota are defined by their mycobiont at the genus level. Further, distinct bacterial families show differences among the three studied genera, and specific amplicon sequence variants further discriminate among lichen species within each genus. A geographic component also determines the composition of these microbial communities among lichen species. Our functional analysis revealed that fungal partners play a key role in synthesizing complex polysaccharides, while bacterial-derived antioxidants and photoprotective mechanisms contribute to desiccation tolerance in lichens. These insights highlight the complex interactions within lichen symbioses that could be relevant in environments such as the paramo ecosystem.",Bacteria|Colombia|Fungi|Lichens|Microbiota|Phylogeny|Species Specificity|Symbiosis|habitat-filtering|lichen|microbiota|paramo|symbiosis,"Chaib De Mares, Maryam|Arciniegas Castro, Emerson|Ulloa, Maria Alejandra|Torres, Jean Marc|Sierra, Maria A|Butler, Daniel J|Mason, Christopher E|Zambrano, María Mercedes|Moncada, Bibiana|Reyes Muñoz, Alejandro",FEMS microbiology ecology,2025,2025-01-28,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Spectral imaging coupled with superior contrast resolution, and ultrahigh spatial resolution (200 μm) offered by PCCT has the potential to revolutionize value-driven imaging. The potential of multicolor PCCT has generated excitement, and renewed interest, in novel contrast agent development for comprehensive disease interrogation, prediction and monitoring of treatment outcomes. Nanoparticles provide a versatile and powerful platform for the development of next generation contrast agents for spectral PCCT. In this article, we review recent developments and use of nanoparticle contrast agents for PCCT.

To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications. First, TLR hyporesponsiveness may be associated with hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands. Second, TLR hyporesponsiveness during MIS-C may be protective, since LYST variant heterozygous carriers exhibited reduced TLR hyporesponsiveness and unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation. Thus, links may exist between genetic background, ability to establish a refractory immune state, and MIS-C clinical spectrum. Third, the possibility exists that prolonged TLR hyporesponsiveness is one of the mechanisms driving long coronavirus disease (COVID), which highlights the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.",LYST|MIS-C|SARS-CoV-2|genetic variants|hyperinflammatory syndrome|innate immunity,"Khan, Rehan|Ji, Weizhen|Guzman Rivera, Jeisac|Madhvi, Abhilasha|Andrews, Tracy|Richlin, Benjamin|Suarez, Christian|Gaur, Sunanda|Hasan, Uzma N|Cuddy, William|Singh, Aalok R|Bukulmez, Hulya|Kaelber, David|Kimura, Yukiko|Ganapathi, Usha|Michailidis, Ioannis E|Ukey, Rahul|Moroso-Fela, Sandra|Kuster, John K|Casseus, Myriam|Roy, Jason|Burns, Jane C|Kleinman, Lawrence C|Horton, Daniel B|Lakhani, Saquib A|Gennaro, Maria Laura","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2025,2025-03-18,Journal Article,HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

We utilized these naturally occurring VOCs in an adapted culture method to detect differences in culturing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without Staphylococcus epidermidis and Aspergillus fumigatus contaminations. The VOC emissions from the cell cultures were extracted and measured from the culture flask headspace using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated Twisters, which were subjected to thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) analysis. In our initial time points of 1 and 2 h, we detected VOC signatures that differentiated the cultures earlier than traditional plating techniques or visualization methods. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to differentiate the analytes from the CHO cells and S. epidermidis- and A. fumigatus-inoculated CHO cultures. A total of 41 compounds with a variable importance in projection (VIP) score greater than 1 was obtained across the models. Similarly, based on the PLS regression analyses to predict the cell concentration of S. epidermidis (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.891) and A. fumigatus (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.375), 15 and 20 relevant compounds were putatively identified, respectively; two known compounds overlapped between the two microbes.

Accurate predictive classification methods are required to correctly identify and treat patients. Here, the onset of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a more serious form of COVID-19, was predicted in a pediatric population using a set of multivariate immunological biomarker expression values. A first-stage bivariate detection of statistically significant biomarkers was obtained from a chosen set of standard cytokines and chemokine biomarkers considered relevant to COVID-19-related infection and disease. To incorporate the observed correlation structure among the resulting set of significant biomarkers, dimension reduction was then applied in the form of principal components. A second-stage logistic regression model using a small number of the principal component variables provided a highly predictive classification model for MIS-C. The resulting model was shown to compare favorably with an artificial neural network-based predictive model.","Adolescent|Biomarkers|COVID-19|Chemokines|Child|Child, Preschool|Cytokines|Female|Humans|Infant|Logistic Models|MIS-C|Male|Multivariate Analysis|SARS-CoV-2|SARS-CoV-2 infection|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|artificial neural network|biomarkers|biplot|correlation|diagnostic testing|dimension reduction|immune system|logistic regression|principal components","Brimacombe, Michael|Jadhav, Aishwarya|Lawrence, David A|Carson, Kyle|Lee, William T|Hogan, Alexander H|Herbst, Katherine W|Lynes, Michael A|Salazar, Juan C",Viruses,2025,2025-02-21,Journal Article,HD105613,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

We aimed to compare odor identification between SCD and cognitively normal (CN) stages and investigate whether cognitive differences moderate olfactory deficits. A systematic search of four databases identified studies assessing olfactory identification and cognitive screening in individuals aged 50+.

Individuals with SCD exhibited lower olfactory identification scores compared to CN participants (SMD = -0.67, 95%CI [-1.31, -0.03], <i>p</i> = .04). Meta-regression revealed a negative association (β = -1.79, p = .02) between cognitive and olfactory differences, indicating that greater cognitive decline was not consistently associated with greater olfactory deficits, lower odor identification scores in SCD occurred despite minimal cognitive differences across groups.

While many drugs target the causative factors, none directly stimulate mucosal wound healing. We found that the specific focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activator, M64HCl, promotes intestinal mucosal healing in mice. This study aims to further validate the therapeutic impact of M64HCl on intestinal mucosal repair in rats as a second species. Wistar rats were assigned to one of four groups: normal control, 1-day injury + vehicle, 4-day injury + vehicle, or 4-day injury + M64HCl. Intestinal injury was induced by serosally applying 75% acetic acid. Immediately after injury, rats received either a continuous infusion of M64HCl (25 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle (saline). Four days post-injury, blood was drawn to measure M64HCl levels and assess liver and kidney function. The intestines were removed and opened, ulcer areas were photographed for size quantification, and tissues were fixed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. M64HCl substantially reduced ulcer area on gross examination, while histological analysis showed alleviation of pathological changes with M64HCl treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed increased immunoreactivity for phosphorylated FAK in the epithelium adjacent to the injury in M64HCl-treated rats. However, there was no change in the percentage of Ki67-positive cells in each crypt at the edge of the ulcer area. Serum creatinine, ALT, and AST levels did not differ between the 4-day injury groups with or without M64HCl treatment. M64HCl, a water-soluble FAK activator, promotes acetic acid-induced ulcer healing in rats and may be useful in treating gastrointestinal mucosal injury.","Acetic Acid|Animals|Disease Models, Animal|Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases|Focal adhesion kinase|Intestinal Mucosa|Male|Mucosal healing|Rats|Rats, Wistar|Small intestine, mucosal injury|Wound Healing","Liu, Guiming|Elsayed, Ahmed Adham R|Kwantwi, Louis Boafo|Gallardo-Macias, Ricardo|Gurvich, Vadim J|Basson, Marc D",BMC gastroenterology,2025,2025-05-08,Journal Article,HL152410,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We investigated whether clinically obtained prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening (PDNAS) using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data can be leveraged to predict preeclampsia risk early in pregnancy (≤16 weeks). Using 1,854 routinely collected clinical PDNAS samples (median, 12.1 weeks) with low-coverage (0.5×) WGS data, we developed a framework to quantify maternal and fetal tissue signatures using nucleosome accessibility, revealing early placental and endothelial dysfunction.

We sought to determine how cardiac biomarkers might differentiate KD from MIS-C. The International Kawasaki Disease Registry enrolled contemporaneous KD and MIS-C pediatric patients from 42 sites from January 2020 through June 2022. The study population included 118 KD patients who met American Heart Association KD criteria and compared them to 946 MIS-C patients who met 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. All included patients had at least one measurement of amino-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) or cardiac troponin I (TnI), and echocardiography. Regression analyses were used to determine associations between cardiac biomarker levels, diagnosis, and cardiac involvement. Higher NTproBNP (≥ 1500 ng/L) and TnI (≥ 20 ng/L) at presentation were associated with MIS-C versus KD with specificity of 77 and 89%, respectively. Higher biomarker levels were associated with shock and intensive care unit admission; higher NTproBNP was associated with longer hospital length of stay. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more pronounced for MIS-C, was also associated with higher biomarker levels. Coronary artery involvement was not associated with either biomarker. Higher NTproBNP and TnI levels are suggestive of MIS-C versus KD and may be clinically useful in their differentiation.

Such efforts have primarily been implemented at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), providing data for large resident populations but hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions or follow-ups. Conversely, building-level wastewater data exhibits increased variability due to rapid daily population dynamics but allows for targeted follow-up interventions or mitigation efforts. Here, we implemented a three-site wastewater sampling strategy on our university-affiliated medical campus from May 2021 to March 2024, comprised of two distinct hospital quadrants and a primarily research laboratory and classroom building. We first addressed several limitations in implementing hospital-level wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling frequency and laboratory techniques. We subsequently improved our ability to model SARS-CoV-2 case counts using wastewater data by performing sensitivity analyses on viral shedding assumptions and testing the utility of internal normalization factors for population size. Our unique infrastructure allowed us to detect intra-hospital dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and diversity and confirmed that direct sequencing of wastewater was able to capture corresponding clinical viral diversity. In contrast, research building wastewater sampling showed that for most non-residential settings, despite low overall viral loads, a threshold approach can still be used to identify peaks in cases or transmission amongst the general population.

A total of 221613 hospitalized patients met the eligibility criteria, including 6454 (2.0%) admitted due to COVID-19 and 215159 (98.0%) for all other conditions. Patients were excluded if they had less than three months of follow-up (due to censoring, cognitive impairment, or death), were younger than 55 years at baseline, or had no prior visit to Mass General Brigham in the year before baseline. The primary outcome was new-onset cognitive impairment, identified via ICD codes and dementia medication prescriptions. The primary analysis estimated the hazard ratio for cognitive impairment with COVID-19 hospitalization relative to other hospitalizations, along with the risk difference at 4.5 years estimated via cumulative incidence functions. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, hospitalization period). Among eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.55 [9.42] years, 55% female), those hospitalized for COVID-19 were significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.05). COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02-1.30], P = 0.018). At 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 12.5% [95% CI: 11.3-13.5] in the COVID-19 group, compared to 11.6% [95% CI: 11.1-12.1] in the non-COVID-19 group. Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing clinically recognized cognitive impairment. Future studies are needed to validate findings in other health care settings. Early screening and intervention for cognitive decline may help optimize long-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients.",,"Mukhija, Sasha|Sunog, Max|Magdamo, Colin|Albers, Mark W",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,2025-03-28,Journal Article|Preprint,DC019579,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing
39242442,,doi:10.1007/s10439-024-03615-9,Human Tooth Crack Image Analysis with Multiple Deep Learning Approaches.,"Tooth cracks, one of the most common dental diseases, can result in the tooth falling apart without prompt treatment; dentists also have difficulty locating cracks, even with X-ray imaging. Indocyanine green (ICG) assisted near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dental imaging technique can solve this problem due to the deep penetration of NIR light and the excellent fluorescence characteristics of ICG. This study extracted 593 human cracked tooth images and 601 non-cracked tooth images from NIR imaging videos. Multiple imaging analysis methods such as classification, object detection, and super-resolution were applied to the dataset for cracked image analysis. Our results showed that machine learning methods could help analyze tooth crack efficiently: the tooth images with cracks and without cracks could be well classified with the pre-trained residual network and squeezenet1_1 models, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% and 94.25%, respectively; the single shot multi-box detector (SSD) was able to recognize cracks, even if the input image was at a different size from the original cracked image; the super-resolution (SR) model, SR-generative adversarial network demonstrated enhanced resolution of crack images using high-resolution concrete crack images as the training dataset. Overall, deep learning model-assisted human crack analysis improves crack identification; the combination of our NIR dental imaging system and deep learning models has the potential to assist dentists in crack diagnosis.","Crack detection|Deep Learning|Deep learning|Human tooth cracks diagnosis|Humans|Image Processing, Computer-Assisted|Indocyanine Green|NIRF dental imaging|Tooth|Tooth Fractures","Li, Zheng|Li, Zhongqiang|Zhang, Ya|Wang, Huaizhi|Li, Xin|Zhang, Jian|Zaid, Waleed|Yao, Shaomian|Xu, Jian",Annals of biomedical engineering,2025,2025-02-01,Journal Article,AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing
40332956,,doi:10.1093/jamia/ocaf064,CDEMapper: enhancing National Institutes of Health common data element use with large language models.,"Common Data Elements (CDEs) standardize data collection and sharing across studies, enhancing data interoperability and improving research reproducibility. However, implementing CDEs presents challenges due to the broad range and variety of data elements. This study aims to develop a CDE mapping tool to bridge the gap between local data elements and National Institutes of Health (NIH) CDEs. We propose CDEMapper, a large language model (LLM)-powered mapping tool designed to assist in mapping local data elements to NIH CDEs. CDEMapper has 3 core modules: (1) CDE indexing and embeddings. NIH CDEs were indexed and embedded to support semantic search; (2) CDE recommendations. The tool combines Elasticsearch (BM25 methods) with GPT services to recommend candidate CDEs and their permissible values; and (3) Human review. Users review and select the best match for their data elements and value sets. We evaluate the tool's recommendation accuracy and usability against manual annotations and testing. CDEMapper offers a publicly available, LLM-powered, and intuitive user interface that consolidates essential and advanced mapping services into a streamlined pipeline. The evaluation results demonstrated that the augmented BM25 with GPT embeddings and a GPT ranker achieved the overall best performance. The usability test also highlighted the effectiveness and efficiency of our tool. This work opens up the potential of using LLMs to assist with CDE mapping when aligning local data elements with NIH CDEs.

Previously, we developed a method to measure VOCs emitted from well-differentiated tracheobronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Using this method, we exposed well-differentiated proximal (PECs) and distal airway epithelial cells (DECs) to varying doses of traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) and wildfire particulates to determine specific VOC signatures after exposure. We utilized PM2.5 TRAP collected from the Caldecott tunnel in Oakland, CA and the 2018 Camp Fire to model ""real-life"" exposures. The VOCs were collected and extracted from Twisters and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Exposure to both types of particulate matter (PM) resulted in specific VOC responses grouped by individual subjects with little overlap. Interestingly the VOCs produced by the PECs and DECs were also differentiated from each other. Our studies suggest that PM exposure induces a specific compartmentalized cellular response that can be exploited for future studies. This response is cell-type specific and potentially related to a phenotype we have yet to uncover.","Air Pollutants|Cells, Cultured|Epithelial Cells|Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry|Humans|PM2.5|Particle Size|Particulate Matter|Vehicle Emissions|Volatile Organic Compounds|airway epithelial cells|air–liquid interface|volatile organic compounds","Linderholm, Angela L|Borras, Eva|Aribindi, Katyayini|Jones, Leilani L|Rojas, Dante E|Bein, Keith|McCartney, Mitchell M|Davis, Cristina E|Harper, Richart W|Kenyon, Nicholas J",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2025,2025-01-01,Journal Article,TR003795,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

However, we hypothesized that type 1 (T1) inflammation, possibly related to viral infection, may also influence corticosteroid response. <b>Objectives:</b> To determine the frequency and within-patient variability of T1-high, T2-high, and T1/T2-high asthma endotypes and whether virally influenced T1-high disease influences corticosteroid response in asthma. <b>Methods:</b> Patients in SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) had sputum collected at baseline, after intramuscular (triamcinolone acetonide) corticosteroid treatment, and at 1- and 3-year follow-ups. Sputum cell RNA was used for whole-transcriptome gene network and viral metagenomic analyses. We then profiled patients as highly expressing T1 and/or T2 gene networks and established the influence of these endotypes on corticosteroid responsiveness and the likelihood of viral transcript detection in the airways. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> We found that 22% and 35% of patients with asthma highly expressed T1 and T2 network genes, respectively, and that 8.5% highly expressed both networks. Asthma severity outcomes were worse in T2-high compared with T1-high asthma and most severe in the T1-high/T2-high subgroup. Corticosteroid treatment strongly suppressed T2 but poorly suppressed T1 gene expression, and corticosteroid-associated improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> occurred only in patients with T1-low/T2-high disease and not in patients with T1-high/T2-high disease. Viral metagenomic analyses uncovered that 24% of asthma sputum samples tested positive for a respiratory virus, and high viral carriage was associated with 14-fold increased risk of T1-high disease. <b>Conclusions:</b> Airway T1 immune responses are relatively common in asthma, are largely corticosteroid resistant, and are associated with subclinical viral infection.",Adrenal Cortex Hormones|Adult|Asthma|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Sputum|Treatment Outcome|Virus Diseases|sputum|transcriptomics|type 1 asthma|type 2 asthma|viral metagenomics,"Fahy, John V|Jackson, Nathan D|Sajuthi, Satria P|Pruesse, Elmar|Moore, Camille M|Everman, Jamie L|Rios, Cydney|Tang, Monica|Gauthier, Marc|Wenzel, Sally E|Bleecker, Eugene R|Castro, Mario|Comhair, Suzy A|Erzurum, Serpil C|Hastie, Annette T|Moore, Wendy|Israel, Elliot|Levy, Bruce D|Denlinger, Loren|Jarjour, Nizar N|Johansson, Mats W|Mauger, David T|Phillips, Brenda R|Sumino, Kaharu|Woodruff, Prescott G|Peters, Michael C|Seibold, Max A",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2025,2025-02-01,Journal Article,HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

This case study outlines the WACKIEST Unit, which focused on wastewater surveillance and COVID-19, the obstacles faced during development and recruitment, and implementation of the WACKIEST Unit in conjunction with a rural wastewater surveillance initiative. The unit was implemented in spring 2023 at a rural high school in Kentucky, spanning 12 days and engaging 190 students. Lessons emphasized the importance of wastewater testing in public health decision-making, particularly in the context of COVID-19. A mobile laboratory provided students with hands-on experience in conducting preliminary analyses of wastewater, and a field trip to the local wastewater treatment plant allowed them to observe real-world wastewater management practices. At the unit's conclusion, students created a public health report aligned with the Evidence-Informed Decision Making in Public Health model, reinforcing the goal of fostering community health resilience. The initiative's success-measured by the unit's completion and positive feedback from students and teachers-supports the creation of online modules for broader dissemination.

Drug level feedback (DLF) can support dose optimization and timely interventions to prevent treatment failure, but current tests are heavily instrumented and centralized. We developed the REverse transcriptase ACTivity crispR (REACTR) for rapid measurement of HIV drugs based on the extent of DNA synthesis by HIV reverse transcriptase. CRISPR-Cas enzymes bind to the synthesized DNA, triggering collateral cleavage of quenched reporters and generating fluorescence. We measured azidothymidine triphosphate (AZT-TP), a key drug in pediatric HIV treatment, and investigated the impact of assay time and DNA template length on REACTR's sensitivity. REACTR selectively measured clinically relevant AZT-TP concentrations in the presence of genomic DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysate.

We have identified a drug lead, named MGC-10, which kills Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), with a MIC of 6 µM, while being harmless to mammalian cells <i>in vitro</i> in that concentration range. The antibacterial activity of MGC-10 was broad against over 50 strains of antibiotic-resistant samples obtained from hospital infections, where MGC-10 inhibited all tested strains of MRSA. Extensive selection and screening with MGC-10 did not yield any resistant strains, indicating it may have universal antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i>. Pharmacokinetics performed in mice suggested that MGC-10 was too toxic for systemic use; however, it appears to have potential as a topical treatment for difficult-to-treat wounds or skin infections by Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. In a mouse skin-infection model with MRSA, MGC-10 performed as well or better than the present topical drug of choice, mupirocin. MGC-10 showed little, if any, accumulation in the livers of topically treated mice. These results bode well for the future use of MGC-10 in clinical application as it could be used to treat a broad range of <i>S. aureus</i> skin infections that are resistant to known antibiotics.IMPORTANCEThere is a critical need for new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections caused by pathogens resistant to many if not all currently available antibiotics. We describe here the identification of a prospective new antibiotic from high-throughput screening of a chemical library. The screening was designed to detect the inhibition of formation of a complex required for bacterial protein synthesis in all bacteria, the ""ternary complex,"" comprised of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), aminoacyl-tRNA, and GTP. The inhibitory compound, renamed MGC-10, was effective against all Gram-positive bacteria, including a wide variety of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) strains. Although apparently too toxic for systemic use, the compound was safe and effective for topical use for treating skin infections in a mouse model. No resistance to the compound has been detected thus far, suggesting the potential to develop this compound for topical use to treat infections, especially those caused by pathogens resistant to existing antibiotics.","(R,R)-tetrahydrochrysene|Administration, Topical|Animals|Anti-Bacterial Agents|Chlorocebus aethiops|FRET|Female|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer|High-Throughput Screening Assays|Male|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Microbial Sensitivity Tests|Peptide Elongation Factor Tu|Protein Binding|RNA, Transfer|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Staphylococcal Skin Infections|Staphylococcus aureus|Vero Cells|ternary complex in protein synthesis|topical antibiotic for Gram-positive pathogens","Mandecki, Wlodek|Chudaev, Maxim|Ye, Wenjuan|Wang, Amy Q|Wilson, Kenneth J|Xu, Xin|Kim, Jisun|Parker, Dane|Alland, David|Kumar, Pradeep|Li, Barry|Yang, Jason H|Kreiswirth, Barry|Mediavilla, Jose R|Marugan, Juan J|Henderson, Mark J|Goldman, Emanuel",Applied and environmental microbiology,2025,2025-01-31,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
40017424,,doi:10.1021/acsnano.4c14913,Deactivated Cas9-Engineered Magnetic Micromotors toward a Point-of-Care Digital Viral RNA Assay.,"Digital nucleic acid assays, known for their high sensitivity and specificity, typically rely on fluorescent readouts and expensive and complex nanowell manufacturing, which constrain their broader use in point-of-care (POC) application. Here, we introduce an alternative digital molecular diagnostics, termed dCRISTOR, by seamlessly integrating deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-engineered micromotors, extraction-free loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), low-cost bright field microscopy, and deep learning-enabled image processing. The micromotor, composed of a polystyrene sphere attached to a magnetic bead, incorporates a dCas9 ribonucleoprotein complex. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) RNA in a sample results in the formation of large-sized amplicons that can be specifically captured by the micromotors, reducing their velocity induced by an external magnetic field. The micromotor is propelled by an external magnetic field, which eliminates the need for chemical fuels, reducing system complexity, and allowing for precise control over micromotor movement, enhancing accuracy and reliability. A convolutional neural network classification-based multiobject tracking algorithm, CNN-MOT, accurately measures the change in micromotor motion, facilitating the binary digital assay format (""1"" or ""0"") for simplified result interpretation without user bias. Incorporating an extraction-free LAMP assay streamlines the dCRISTOR workflow, enabling qualitative HIV-1 detection in spiked plasma (<i>n</i> = 21) that demonstrates 100% sensitivity and specificity and achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.96 copies/μL. The assay also achieved 100% correlation with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in clinical patient samples (<i>n</i> = 9).

To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications. First, TLR hyporesponsiveness may be associated with hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands. Second, TLR hyporesponsiveness during MIS-C may be protective, since LYST variant heterozygous carriers exhibited reduced TLR hyporesponsiveness and unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation. Thus, links may exist between genetic background, ability to establish a refractory immune state, and MIS-C clinical spectrum. Third, the possibility exists that prolonged TLR hyporesponsiveness is one of the mechanisms driving long coronavirus disease (COVID), which highlights the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.",LYST|MIS-C|SARS-CoV-2|genetic variants|hyperinflammatory syndrome|innate immunity,"Khan, Rehan|Ji, Weizhen|Guzman Rivera, Jeisac|Madhvi, Abhilasha|Andrews, Tracy|Richlin, Benjamin|Suarez, Christian|Gaur, Sunanda|Hasan, Uzma N|Cuddy, William|Singh, Aalok R|Bukulmez, Hulya|Kaelber, David|Kimura, Yukiko|Ganapathi, Usha|Michailidis, Ioannis E|Ukey, Rahul|Moroso-Fela, Sandra|Kuster, John K|Casseus, Myriam|Roy, Jason|Burns, Jane C|Kleinman, Lawrence C|Horton, Daniel B|Lakhani, Saquib A|Gennaro, Maria Laura","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2025,2025-03-18,Journal Article,HD105619,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Therefore, tunable, sensitive, high-throughput assays are needed to help diagnose future virion-mediated outbreaks.

Existing biomarkers have limited ability to predict treatment response or survival, exposing many patients to the potential toxicity of treatment without certain clinical benefit. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a non-invasive, real-time biomarker that could address these challenges. We analyzed 137 plasma samples from 16 patients with R/M HNSCC undergoing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapy. A tumor-informed, highly sensitive next-generation sequencing liquid biopsy assay (RaDaR, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc.) was applied to track ctDNA changes at baseline and throughout treatment. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between ctDNA negativity and key clinical outcomes: disease control (best objective response of stable disease, partial response, or complete response), three-year overall survival (OS), and three-year progression-free survival (PFS). We also assessed a machine learning model to predict disease progression based on ctDNA dynamics. Multivariable analysis revealed that ctDNA negativity during treatment was significantly associated with improved disease control (OR 21.7, 95% CI 1.86-754.88, p=0.0317), three-year OS (HR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00-0.47, p=0.0103), and three-year PFS (HR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.37, p=0.0057). The machine learning model predicted disease progression with 88% accuracy (AUC 0.89). Serial ctDNA monitoring predicted disease control, survival, and progression in patients with R/M HNSCC receiving treatment with ICB, suggesting that incorporation of ctDNA into clinical practice could enhance treatment decision-making for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.",,"Ruiz-Torres, Daniel A|Merkin, Ross D|Bryan, Michael|Mendel, Julia|Efthymiou, Vasileios|Roberts, Thomas|Patel, Manisha|Park, Jong C|Chevalier, Amber|Murray, Clodagh|Gates, Lisa|Pipinikas, Christodoulos|Stott, Shannon L|Fisch, Adam S|Wirth, Lori J|Faden, Daniel L",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,2025-01-28,Journal Article|Preprint,TR003793,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

The current means to pharmacologically treat excessive uncontrolled lung inflammation needs improvement because many treatments are or will become immunosuppressive. The inflammatory response evolved to protect the host from microbes, injury, and environmental insults. This response brings phagocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue site to phagocytize and neutralize bacterial invaders and enables airway antimicrobial functions. This physiologic response is ideally self-limited with initiation and resolution phases. Polyunsaturated essential fatty acids are precursors to potent molecules that govern both phases. In the initiation phase, arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandins and leukotrienes that activate leukocytes to transmigrate from postcapillary venules. The omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., DHA and EPA) are precursors to resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which are families of chemically distinct mediators with potent functions in resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in the respiratory system.",Animals|Humans|Inflammation Mediators|Respiratory System|cysteinyl-specialized proresolving mediators|efferocytosis|lung disease|polyunsaturated fatty acid|proresolving mediators|resolvins,"Serhan, Charles N|Levy, Bruce D",Annual review of physiology,2025,2025-02-01,Journal Article|Review,HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Many factors have contributed to this paucity, including the biological complexity of addiction, regulatory challenges, and a historical lack of enthusiasm among pharmaceutical companies to commit resources to this disease space. Despite these headwinds, the recent opioid crisis has highlighted the devastating consequences of SUDs for both individuals and society, stimulating urgent efforts to identify novel treatment approaches. In addition, several neurobiological systems have been recently implicated in unique aspects of drug reward, opening the door to candidate medications with novel mechanisms of action. Here, we provide an overview of efforts to target several of these new systems, with a focus on those that are the subject of ongoing clinical trials as well as being areas of interest among the authors' research groups (MHJ, MTB, NAE). Specifically, we discuss new classes of medications targeting the serotonin 2A receptor (i.e., psychedelics), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, cannabidiol, dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor, orexin/hypocretin, and oxytocin receptor systems, as well as emergent approaches for modulating the more canonical dopaminergic system via agonist therapies for stimulant use disorders.

They majorly serve as a communication channel between cells. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are gaining wide attention in several pathophysiological conditions and are considered as early diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recently, exosomal miRNAs have been identified as key players during obesity and coexisting risk elements, unraveling their pivotal role in the progression of obesity induced pathophysiological conditions. In this review, the latest developments in the role of exosomal cargo, specifically miRNAs, in obesity are highlighted.

The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed once-fatal HIV disease into a manageable chronic condition that now makes the need for VL testing which aims to satisfy international suppression targets 95-95-95 al l the more essential. Therefore, considering the complexity and diversity of HIV infection, it is essential to develop rapid diagnostic technologies suitable for different clinical situations. Here, we report on a multiplexed PCR device developed for simple and efficient quantification of HIV-1 or HIV-2 viral loads using finger-pricked whole blood from rural decentralized settings. This device is comprised of a previously developed RNA extraction module combined with an optimized real-time PCR amplification system. Together, these combine to simultaneously detect and differentiate HIV-1 & 2; as well are adopting a testing control of RNase P allowing for full diagnostic analysis from one sample. Our device also includes an intuitive user interface and is completely autonomous so it can serve individuals in remote areas who are unfamiliar with the field of medical testing. They get the results in a very short time of around 70 min and hence save on testing times without leaving accuracy behind. The efficiency and effectiveness of the device were validated through the analysis of 30 clinical samples, yielding a sensitivity of 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The specificity was found to be 100% for HIV-1 and 90.91% for HIV-2, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. One of the most attractive things about this device is that it comes in comparison to all other counterparts. Given that you can run the assay for less than $10, it could be an economically viable way to use this as a broadscale test in regions where healthcare budgets don't allow others. Hence it is quite a useful device to aid HIV management in resource-limited settings, where conventional laboratory facilities are out of reach due its simplicity and affordability with rapid output. The point-of-care test is an effective, low-cost, high quality diagnostic tool-promoting rapid testing for HIV-inexpensively overcoming the barriers to efficient control of and care in resource-limited settings.","Biosensing Techniques|Equipment Design|HIV Infections|HIV-1|HIV-2|Human immunodeficiency viruses|Humans|Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction|Nucleic acid testing|Quantification|RNA, Viral|Resource-Limited Settings|Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|Self-testing|Viral Load|Viral load","Liu, Tianyi|Politza, Anthony J|Ahamed, Md Ahasan|Kshirsagar, Aneesh|Zhu, Yusheng|Guan, Weihua",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2025,2025-03-01,Journal Article,HD105610,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

We used plasma samples collected from subjects diagnosed with MIS-C and compared them first to controls with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and then to controls with pneumonia or Kawasaki disease. We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm-based classification schemes were used to analyze protein pathways. We assessed diagnostic accuracy using internal and external cross-validation. Proteomic analysis of a training dataset containing MIS-C (N=17), and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=20) identified 643 proteins, of which 101 were differentially expressed. Plasma proteins associated with inflammation and coagulation increased and those associated with lipid metabolism decreased in MIS-C relative to controls. The SVM machine learning algorithm identified a three-protein model (ORM1, AZGP1, SERPINA3) that achieved 90.0% specificity, 88.2% sensitivity, and 93.5% area under the curve (AUC) distinguishing MIS-C from controls in the training set. Performance was retained in the validation dataset utilizing MIS-C (N=17) and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=10) (90.0% specificity, 84.2% sensitivity, 87.4% AUC).

We also developed a software tool that may be used to evaluate other protein pathway signatures using our data.

However, despite their widespread use, CMap-based methods have thus far been agnostic to the biological activity of drugs as well as to the genomic effects of drugs in multiple disease contexts. Here, we present a network-based statistical approach, Pathopticon, that uses CMap to build cell type-specific gene-drug perturbation networks and integrates these networks with cheminformatic data and diverse disease phenotypes to prioritize drugs in a cell type-dependent manner. We build cell type-specific gene-drug perturbation networks from CMap data using a statistical procedure we call Quantile-based Instance Z-score Consensus (QUIZ-C). Using these networks and a large-scale disease-gene network consisting of 569 disease signatures from the Enrichr database, we calculate Pathophenotypic Congruity Scores (PACOS) between input gene signatures and drug perturbation signatures and combine these scores with cheminformatic data from ChEMBL to prioritize drugs. We benchmark our approach by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) for 73 gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) using target gene expression profiles from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). We validate the drugs predicted in our proofs-of-concept using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments. Cell type-specific gene-drug perturbation networks built using QUIZ-C are topologically distinct, reflecting the biological uniqueness of the cell lines in CMap, and are enriched in known drug targets. Pathopticon demonstrates a better prediction performance than solely cheminformatic measures as well as state-of-the-art network and deep learning-based methods. Top predictions made by Pathopticon have high chemical structural diversity, suggesting their potential for building compound libraries. In proof-of-concept applications on vascular diseases, we demonstrate that Pathopticon helps guide in vitro experiments by identifying pathways that are potentially regulated by the predicted therapeutic candidates.

We examined the impact of the pandemic on the diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the United States. We performed a historical cohort study using US commercial insurance data (2016-2021) to identify children aged <18 years without prior JIA diagnosis or treatment in the prior ≥12 months. New JIA diagnoses were identified using a combination of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, location, and timing of medical services. Crude rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of JIA diagnosis per 100,000 enrolled children per quarter were estimated and stratified by age group, sex, region, JIA type, and uveitis. The incidence rate ratio (95% CI) for JIA diagnosis was estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for various demographic variables. From 2018-2021, 643 children were diagnosed with JIA. Crude new JIA diagnoses per 100,000 children per quarter dropped from 2.62 (95% CI, 2.39-2.87) prepandemic to 1.94 (95% CI, 1.66-2.25) during the pandemic. Declines in JIA diagnosis were more apparent in the US Northeast and West regions and among children aged 6-11 years. After adjustment for covariates, JIA diagnoses fell by 30% during the pandemic compared with the prior 3 years (IRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83). Compared with the prepandemic period, JIA was diagnosed 30% less often during the early pandemic among commercially insured children in the United States.

The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment.

Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.","Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Alzheimer Disease|Alzheimer’s disease|Cognitive Dysfunction|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Mild cognitive impairment|Odorants|Olfaction|Olfaction Disorders|Olfactory Perception|Remote assessment|Screening|Smell","Jobin, Benoît|Magdamo, Colin|Delphus, Daniela|Runde, Andreas|Reineke, Sean|Soto, Alysa Alejandro|Ergun, Beyzanur|Mukhija, Sasha|Albers, Alefiya Dhilla|Albers, Mark W",Scientific reports,2025,2025-03-24,Journal Article,DC019579,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

The combined positive score (CPS) for PD-L1 is the only biomarker approved to predict response to ICB and has limited performance. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) have shown promising potential for predicting response to ICB. However, their exact composition, size, and spatial biology in HNSCC remain understudied. To elucidate the impact of TLS spatial biology in response to ICB, we utilized pre-ICB tumor tissue sections from 9 responders (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 11 non-responders (progressive disease) classified via RECISTv1.1. A custom multi-immunofluorescence (mIF) staining assay was applied to characterize tumor cells (pan-cytokeratin), T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19, CD20), myeloid cells (CD16, CD56, CD163), dendritic cells (LAMP3), fibroblasts (α Smooth Muscle Actin), proliferative status (Ki67) and immunoregulatory molecules (PD1). A machine learning model was employed to measure the effect of spatial metrics on achieving a response to ICB. A higher density of B cells (CD20+) was found in responders compared to non-responders to ICB (<i>p</i> = 0.022). The presence of TLS within 100 µm of the tumor was associated with improved overall (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and progression-free survival (<i>p</i> = 0.03). A multivariate machine learning model identified TLS density as a leading predictor of response to ICB with 80% accuracy. Immune cell densities and TLS spatial location play a critical role in the response to ICB in HNSCC and may potentially outperform CPS as a predictor of response.","Aged|Biomarkers, Tumor|Female|Head and Neck Neoplasms|Head and neck cancer|Humans|Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors|Male|Middle Aged|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck|Tertiary Lymphoid Structures|Tumor Microenvironment|immune checkpoint blockade|spatial biology|tertiary lymphoid structures","Ruiz-Torres, Daniel A|Bryan, Michael E|Hirayama, Shun|Merkin, Ross D|Luciani, Evelyn|Roberts, Thomas J|Patel, Manisha|Park, Jong C|Wirth, Lori J|Sadow, Peter M|Sade-Feldman, Moshe|Stott, Shannon L|Faden, Daniel L",Oncoimmunology,2025,2025-12-01,Journal Article,TR003793,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold-standard molecular detection method, thermocycling using Peltier heaters presents challenges in decentralized settings. Recent work has demonstrated plasmonic PCR, where nanomaterials on a surface or nanoparticles in solution heat upon stimulation by light, as a promising method for rapid thermocycling. Heating of a solution via nanoparticles suspended in solution has been demonstrated in PCR tubes, but not on microfluidic chips.

40028017,PMC11865829,doi:10.21769/BioProtoc.5189,Novel Workflows for Separate Isolation of Pathogen RNA or DNA from Wastewater: Detection by Innovative and Conventional qPCR.,"Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) can provide a wealth of information regarding the health status of communities from measurements of nucleic acids found in wastewater. Processing workflows for WBS typically include sample collection, a primary concentration step, and lysis of the microbes to release nucleic acids, followed by nucleic acid purification and molecular-based quantification. This manuscript provides workflows from beginning to end with an emphasis on filtration-based concentration approaches coupled with specific lysis and nucleic acid extraction processes. Here, two WBS processing approaches are presented, one focusing on RNA-specific pathogens and the other focused on DNA-specific pathogens found within wastewater: 1) The RNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing RNA viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) couples electronegative filtration of wastewater with the placement of the filter within a lysis buffer followed by direct RNA extraction. 2) The DNA-specific approach, employed for analyzing DNA pathogens like <i>Candida auris</i>, uses size selection membranes during filtration, subsequently followed by a lysis buffer, bead-beating, and DNA extraction. Separate workflows for RNA versus DNA isolations have the advantage of improving the detection of the target pathogen. A novel aspect of the RNA-specific workflow is the direct extraction of nucleic acids from filter lysates, which shows enhanced recoveries, whereas the DNA-specific approach requires bead beating prior to extraction. Novelty is also provided in a new qPCR approach called Volcano 2nd Generation (V2G), which uses a polymerase capable of using RNA as a template, bypassing the reverse transcriptase step normally required for qPCR. Key features • Membrane filtration approaches for concentrating suspended solids from wastewater. After concentration, workflows are optimized for separate recovery of RNA and DNA. • Unique polymerase utilized to perform qPCR analysis, foregoing reverse transcription, for RNA. • Sample products for use with other molecular techniques (e.g., sequencing) as workflow approaches generate high-quality, concentrated nucleic acid extracts with minimal inhibitors. • Validated through COVID-19 surveillance where >1,000 samples of wastewater and >3,000 filter concentrates produced from these samples have been created and analyzed, with published results. <b>This complete protocol was used in:</b> J Biomol Tech (2023), DOI: 10.7171/3fc1f5fe.dfa8d906.",Bead beating|Membrane filtration|Nucleic acids|Pathogen detection|Wastewater,"Babler, Kristina M|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M|Sharkey, Mark E|Amirali, Ayaaz",Bio-protocol,2025,2025-02-20,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

To characterize the clinical features of BMZ-thick asthma and to determine if BMZ thickness accompanies specific patterns of inflammation in the airway epithelium. Design-based stereology was used to quantify BMZ thickness in endobronchial biopsy tissue sections from 109 asthma patients and 41 healthy controls from the Severe Asthma Research Program-3 whose participants had undergone spirometry and gene expression profiling in airway epithelial brushings. The upper 90th percentile value for BMZ thickness in the healthy cohort was 2.9 µM, and 35% of the asthma cohort had values above this upper limit. Compared to BMZ-thin asthma patients, BMZ-thick asthma patients were younger and had higher blood eosinophil numbers and serum immunoglobulin E levels that were specific to animal proteins. Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was significantly lower in BMZ-thick than in BMZ-thin patients, but post-bronchodilator FEV1 was not. Upregulation of genes signifying interleukin-13 activation and presence of mast cells were evident in epithelial brushings in BMZ-thick patients, but gene signatures for activation by interferon gamma or interleukin-17 were not.

One approach for documenting disease spread includes wastewater (WW) surveillance of the virus that causes COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) and other infectious pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether wastewater can be used to track children's health at grade schools in an underserved community, which was vulnerable due to limited health-based data and difficulties in implementing mitigation measures. The 18-month study was initiated during January 2022 at 9 grade schools (3 high, 2 middle, and 4 elementary schools) characterized as low income. Children's health was evaluated through absenteeism due to difficulties in attaining representative clinical diagnoses through school-based clinics. Wastewater measurements of SARS-CoV-2 were available weekly through grab sample collection and RNA extraction followed by quantification using qPCR. The average absenteeism rate was 7.1%, ranging from 4.6% to 12.5% per school. Fraction of WW samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 38% with SARS-Cov-2 levels ranging from detection limits (100 gc/L) to a maximum of 10.2 million gc/L. When data were aggregated across all schools, a statistically significant association was observed between weekly absenteeism rates and WW SARS-CoV-2 with a one percent increase in the log<sub>e</sub> WW SARS-CoV-2 associated with a 1.4% increase in student absence (p < 0.05). When evaluating the data by individual school, this association was strongest at schools with enclosed architecture characterized by limited natural ventilation. For schools with limited resources for clinical diagnosis of illnesses, school absenteeism coupled with wastewater-based monitoring should be utilized for assessing overall health of student populations. Strategies to maintain schools open during pandemics should include consideration of school architecture along with appropriate messaging of WW monitoring results to inform administrators and families.",Absenteeism|COVID-19|Child|Humans|SARS-CoV-2|School Absenteeism|Schools|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Surveillance,"Solo-Gabriele, Helena M|Guevara, Gabriela|Kumar, Naresh|Amirali, Ayaaz|Babler, Kristina M|Beaver, Cynthia C|Comerford, Samuel|Ferraris, Maria|Solle, Natasha Schaefer|Sharkey, Mark E|Gwynn, Lisa",The Science of the total environment,2025,2025-01-10,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

To address this challenge, we developed a system to control the motion of DNA-based synthetic motors using light. DNA motors are composed of a central chassis particle modified with DNA ""legs"" that hybridize to RNA ""fuel"", and move upon enzymatic consumption of RNA. We first concealed RNA fuel sites using photocleavable oligonucleotides that block DNA leg binding. Upon UV activation, the RNA blocking strands dissociate, exposing the RNA fuel and initiating active, directional motion. We also created a ""brake"" system using photocleavable DNA stalling strands, anchoring the motors until UV light removes the ""brake"" while simultaneously ""fueling"" the motors, initiating spatiotemporally controlled stop → go motion. Additionally, we modified the ""brake"" system to activate the motors via a chemical input, while an optical input is required to fuel the motors. This dual-input approach, functioning as an ""AND"" gate, demonstrates the potential for DNA motors to perform light-triggered computational tasks.

However, the process remains a ""black box"" and does not help clinicians in understanding the electrocardiographic changes at an individual level. we propose a nonparametric feature extraction approach to identify features that are associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). We apply functional principal component analysis to the raw ECG tracings collected in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. We define and select the features using ECGs from participants enrolled in Phase I (2003-2008) of the study. Cox proportional hazards models are used to evaluate the association of selected ECG features and their changes with the incident risk of AF during study follow-up. The findings are then validated in ECGs from participants enrolled in Phase III (2013-2015). We identify four features that are related to the P-wave amplitude, QRS complex and ST segment. Both their initial measurement and 3-year changes are associated with the development of AF. In particular, one standard deviation in the 3-year decline of the P-wave amplitude is independently associated with a 29% increased risk of incident AF in the multivariable model (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: [1.16, 1.43]). Compared with deep learning methods, our features are intuitive and can provide insights into the longitudinal ECG changes at an individual level that precede the development of AF.",,"Yang, Wei|Deo, Rajat|Guo, Wensheng",Communications medicine,2025,2025-02-02,Journal Article,DK130067,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

In this study, a novel miR-133a zipper nanoparticle (NP) system that integrates miRNA zipper technology with rolling circle transcription (RCT) to achieve targeted delivery and specific regulation of miR-133a in adipocytes, is presented. This innovative approach can greatly enhance the delivery and release of miR-133a zippers, increasing the expression of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial biogenesis. he miR-133a zipper NP is utilized for the delivery of miRNA zipper-blocking miR-133a, an endogenous inhibitor of Prdm16 expression, to enhance the thermogenic activity of adipocytes by modulating their transcriptional program. Inhibition of miR-133a through the miR-133a zipper NP leads to more significant upregulation of thermogenic gene expression (Prdm16 and Ucp1) than with the free miR-133a zipper strand. Furthermore, miR-133a zipper NPs increase the number of mitochondria and induce heat production, reducing the size of 3D adipose spheroids. In short, this study emphasizes the role of RNA NPs in improving RNAi stability and specificity and paves the way for broader applications in gene therapy.

However, the wet lab constraints (economic, infrastructural, and personnel) of translating novel virus variant sequence information to meaningful immunological and structural insights that are valuable for the development of broadly acting countermeasures (especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses) remain a challenge in many resource-limited settings. Here, we describe a workflow that couples wastewater surveillance, high-throughput sequencing, phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and virus capsid structure modeling for the genotype-to-serotype characterization of uncultivated picornavirus sequences identified in wastewater. Specifically, we analyzed canine picornaviruses (CanPVs), which are uncultivated and yet-to-be-assigned members of the family <i>Picornaviridae</i> that cause systemic infections in canines. We analyzed 118 archived (stored at -20 °C) wastewater (WW) samples representing a population of ~700,000 persons in southwest USA between October 2019 to March 2020 and October 2020 to March 2021. Samples were pooled into 12 two-liter volumes by month, partitioned (into filter-trapped solids [FTSs] and filtrates) using 450 nm membrane filters, and subsequently concentrated to 2 mL (1000×) using 10,000 Da MW cutoff centrifugal filters. The 24 concentrates were subjected to RNA extraction, CanPV complete capsid single-contig RT-PCR, Illumina sequencing, phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and structure prediction. We detected CanPVs in 58.3% (14/24) of the samples generated 13,824,046 trimmed Illumina reads and 27 CanPV contigs. Phylogenetic and pairwise identity analyses showed eight CanPV genotypes (intragenotype divergence <14%) belonging to four clusters, with intracluster divergence of <20%. Similarity analysis, immuno-informatics, and virus protomer and capsid structure prediction suggested that the four clusters were likely distinct serological types, with predicted cluster-distinguishing B-cell epitopes clustered in the northern and southern rims of the canyon surrounding the 5-fold axis of symmetry. Our approach allows forgenotype-to-serotype characterization of uncultivated picornavirus sequences by coupling phylogenetics, immuno-informatics, and virus capsid structure prediction. This consequently bypasses a major wet lab-associated bottleneck, thereby allowing resource-limited settings to leapfrog from wastewater-sourced genomic data to valuable immunological insights necessary for the development of prophylaxis and other mitigation measures.","Animals|Capsid|Capsid Proteins|Dog Diseases|Dogs|Genetic Variation|Genome, Viral|Genotype|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Phylogeny|Picornaviridae|Picornaviridae Infections|United States|Wastewater|genotype-to-serotype prediction|immuno-informatics|virus capsid structure prediction|wastewater targeted sequencing","Faleye, Temitope O C|Skidmore, Peter|Elyaderani, Amir|Adhikari, Sangeet|Kaiser, Nicole|Smith, Abriana|Yanez, Allan|Perleberg, Tyler|Driver, Erin M|Halden, Rolf U|Varsani, Arvind|Scotch, Matthew",Viruses,2024,2024-07-24,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",LM013129,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Following COVID-19 infection, abnormalities on pulmonary function tests (PFT) are common. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate for any correlation between PFT abnormalities and impairment in HRQoL scores following COVID-19 infection. This is an analysis of a prospective cohort of patients in Louisville, KY who were infected with COVID-19.

Here, we present the design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called DNA NanoGripper, that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by naturally evolved human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages. Each NanoGripper finger consists of three phalanges connected by three rotatable joints that are bendable in response to the binding of other entities. NanoGripper functions are enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We demonstrate that the NanoGripper can be engineered to effectively interact with and capture nanometer-scale objects, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. With multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate a fluorescent signal that is enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a highly sensitive biosensor that selectively detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ~100 copies per milliliter, providing a sensitivity equal to that of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

Primary hypothyroidism is a common comorbid condition, but little is known about its association with COVID-19 severity and outcomes. This study aims to identify the frequency of hypothyroidism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as well as describe the differences in outcomes between patients with and without pre-existing hypothyroidism using an observational, multinational registry. In an observational cohort study we enrolled patients 18 years or older, with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection between March 2020 and February 2021. The primary outcomes were (1) the disease severity defined as per the World Health Organization Scale for Clinical Improvement, which is an ordinal outcome corresponding with the highest severity level recorded during a patient's index COVID-19 hospitalization, (2) in-hospital mortality and (3) hospital-free days. Secondary outcomes were the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU mortality. Among the 20,366 adult patients included in the study, pre-existing hypothyroidism was identified in 1616 (7.9%). The median age for the Hypothyroidism group was 70 (interquartile range: 59-80) years, and 65% were female and 67% were White. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (68%), diabetes (42%), dyslipidemia (37%) and obesity (28%). After adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, admission date in the quarter year since March 2020, race, smoking history and other comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia), pre-existing hypothyroidism was not associated with higher odds of severe disease using the World Health Organization disease severity index (odds ratio [OR]: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.13; p = .69), in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.15; p = .58) or differences in hospital-free days (estimated difference 0.01 days; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.47; p = .97). Pre-existing hypothyroidism was not associated with ICU admission or ICU mortality in unadjusted as well as in adjusted analysis. In an international registry, hypothyroidism was identified in around 1 of every 12 adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Pre-existing hypothyroidism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with higher disease severity or increased risk of mortality or ICU admissions. However, more research on the possible effects of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland and its function is needed in the future.","Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|COVID-19|COVID‐19|COVID‐19 disease severity|Cohort Studies|Comorbidity|Female|Hospital Mortality|Hospitalization|Humans|Hypothyroidism|Intensive Care Units|Male|Middle Aged|Registries|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index|hypothyroidism|mortality","Bogojevic, Marija|Bansal, Vikas|Pattan, Vishwanath|Singh, Romil|Tekin, Aysun|Sharma, Mayank|La Nou, Abigail T|LeMahieu, Allison M|Hanson, Andrew C|Schulte, Phillip J|Deo, Neha|Qamar, Shahraz|Zec, Simon|Valencia Morales, Diana J|Perkins, Nicholas|Kaufman, Margit|Denson, Joshua L|Melamed, Roman|Banner-Goodspeed, Valerie M|Christie, Amy B|Tarabichi, Yasir|Heavner, Smith|Kumar, Vishakha K|Walkey, Allan J|Gajic, Ognjen|Bhagra, Sumit|Kashyap, Rahul|Lal, Amos|Domecq, Juan Pablo|",Clinical endocrinology,2024,2024-07-01,Journal Article|Observational Study,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) exemplify the complexities and diversities that complicate their early detection and the development of effective treatments. Amid these challenges, the emergence of nanotechnology and extracellular vesicles (EVs) signals a new dawn for treating and diagnosing CNS ailments. EVs are cellularly derived lipid bilayer nanosized particles that are pivotal in intercellular communication within the CNS and have the potential to revolutionize targeted therapeutic delivery and the identification of novel biomarkers. Integrating EVs with nanotechnology amplifies their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, opening new avenues for managing CNS diseases. This review focuses on examining the fascinating interplay between EVs and nanotechnology in CNS theranostics. Through highlighting the remarkable advancements and unique methodologies, we aim to offer valuable perspectives on how these approaches can bring about a revolutionary change in disease management. The objective is to harness the distinctive attributes of EVs and nanotechnology to forge personalized, efficient interventions for CNS disorders, thereby providing a beacon of hope for affected individuals. In short, the confluence of EVs and nanotechnology heralds a promising frontier for targeted and impactful treatments against CNS diseases, which continue to pose significant public health challenges.

In cancer, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) happens which results in lipid peroxidation with a major product of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Adduction by HNE causes alteration to the structure of proteins, leading to loss of function. Blebbing of EVs carrying these HNE-adducted proteins as a cargo or carrying HNE-adducted on EV membrane are methods for clearing these molecules by the cells. We have referred to these EVs as Redox EVs. Here, we utilize a surface tension-mediated extraction process, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), for the rapid and efficient isolation of intact Redox EVs, from a mixed population of EVs derived from human glioblastoma cell line LN18. After optimizing different parameters, two populations of EVs were analyzed, those isolated from the sample (Redox EVs) and those remaining in the original sample (Remaining EVs). Electron microscopic imaging was used to confirm the presence of HNE adducts on the outer leaflet of Redox EVs. Moreover, the population of HNE-adducted Redox EVs shows significantly different characteristics to those of Remaining EVs including smaller size EVs and a more negative zeta potential EVs. We further treated glioblastoma cells (LN18), radiation-resistant glioblastoma cells (RR-LN18), and normal human astrocytes (NHA) with both Remaining and Redox EV populations. Our results indicate that Redox EVs promote the growth of glioblastoma cells, likely through the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and cause injury to normal astrocytes. In contrast, Remaining EVs have minimal impact on the viability of both glioblastoma cells and NHA cells. Thus, isolating a subpopulation of EVs employing ESP-based immunoaffinity could pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of how subtypes of EVs, such as those containing HNE-adducted proteins, induce biological changes in the cells that take up these EVs.","4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE)|Aldehydes|Cell Line, Tumor|EV isolation|EV purification|Extracellular Vesicles|Extracellular vesicles|Glioblastoma|Humans|Immunoaffinity|Oxidation-Reduction|Redox EVs","Banadaki, Mohammad Dehghan|Rummel, Nicole G|Backus, Spencer|Butterfield, David Allan|St Clair, Daret K|Campbell, James M|Zhong, Weixiong|Mayer, Kristy|Berry, Scott M|Chaiswing, Luksana",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2024,2024-11-01,Journal Article,DA053903,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

The fabrication technique is simple, yet the batch-to-batch variation of LIG quality is not well documented in the literature. In this study, we conduct experiments to characterize batch-to-batch variation in the manufacturing of LIG electrodes for applications in electrochemical sensing. Numerous batches of 36 LIG electrodes were synthesized using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser system on polyimide film. The LIG material was characterized using goniometry, stereomicroscopy, open circuit potentiometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Hydrophobicity and electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry) indicate that LIG electrode batch-to-batch variation is less than 5% when using a commercial reference and counter electrode. Metallization of LIG led to a significant increase in peak current and specific capacitance (area between anodic/cathodic curve). However, batch-to-batch variation increased to approximately 30%. Two different platinum electrodeposition techniques were studied, including galvanostatic and frequency-modulated electrodeposition. The study shows that formation of metallized LIG electrodes with high specific capacitance and peak current may come at the expense of high batch variability. This design tradeoff has not been discussed in the literature and is an important consideration if scaling sensor designs for mass use is desired. This study provides important insight into the variation of LIG material properties for scalable development of LIG sensors. Additional studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of this variability so that strategies to improve the repeatability may be developed for improving quality control.

38695741,,doi:10.1021/acsami.4c05264,Biolayer-Interferometry-Guided Functionalization of Screen-Printed Graphene for Label-Free Electrochemical Virus Detection.,"Additive manufacturing holds promise for rapid prototyping and low-cost production of biosensors for diverse pathogens. Among additive manufacturing methods, screen printing is particularly desirable for high-throughput production of sensing platforms. However, this technique needs to be combined with carefully formulated inks, rapid postprocessing, and selective functionalization to meet all requirements for high-performance biosensing applications. Here, we present screen-printed graphene electrodes that are processed with thermal annealing to achieve high surface area and electrical conductivity for sensitive biodetection via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As a proof-of-concept, this biosensing platform is utilized for electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2. To ensure reliable specificity in the presence of multiple variants, biolayer interferometry (BLI) is used as a label-free and dynamic screening method to identify optimal antibodies for concurrent affinity to the Spike S1 proteins of Delta, Omicron, and Wild Type SARS-CoV-2 variants while maintaining low affinity to competing pathogens such as Influenza H1N1. The BLI-identified antibodies are robustly bound to the graphene electrode surface via oxygen moieties that are introduced during the thermal annealing process. The resulting electrochemical immunosensors achieve superior metrics including rapid detection (55 s readout following 15 min of incubation), low limits of detection (approaching 500 ag/mL for the Omicron variant), and high selectivity toward multiple variants. Importantly, the sensors perform well on clinical saliva samples detecting as few as 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, following CDC protocols. The combination of the screen-printed graphene sensing platform and effective antibody selection using BLI can be generalized to a wide range of point-of-care immunosensors.","Biosensing Techniques|COVID-19|Electrochemical Techniques|Electrodes|Graphite|Humans|Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype|Interferometry|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|additive manufacturing|biosensing|electrochemical impedance spectroscopy|immunosensor|printed electronics","Szydlowska, Beata M|Pola, Cícero C|Cai, Zizhen|Chaney, Lindsay E|Hui, Janan|Sheets, Robert|Carpenter, Jeremiah|Dean, Delphine|Claussen, Jonathan C|Gomes, Carmen L|Hersam, Mark C",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2024,2024-05-15,Journal Article,AA029328,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

BMP signaling negatively regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in lung cancer cells. The impact of inhibiting BMP signaling on mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect this has on the survival of NSLC and leukemia cells are not known. Utilizing the BMP type 2 receptor (BMPR2) JL189, BMPR2 knockout (KO) in cancer cells, and BMP loss of function mutants in <i>C elegans</i>, we determined the effects of BMPR2 inhibition (BMPR2i) on TCA cycle metabolic intermediates, mitochondrial respiration, and the regulation of mitochondrial superoxide anion (SOA) and Ca<sup>++</sup> levels. We also examined whether BMPR2i altered the threshold cancer therapeutics induce cell death in NSLC and leukemia cell lines. KO of the mitochondria uniporter (MCU) was used to determine the mechanism BMPR2i regulates the uptake of Ca<sup>++</sup> into the mitochondria, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and cell death. BMPR2i increases mtCa<sup>++</sup> levels and enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in both NSLC and leukemia cell lines that is conserved in C elegans. BMPR2i induced increase in mtCa<sup>++</sup> levels is regulated through the MCU, effecting mitochondria mass and cell survival. BMPR2i synergistically induced cell death when combined with BCL-2 inhibitors or microtubule targeting agents in both NSLC and leukemia cells. Cell death is caused by synergistic increase in mitochondrial ROS and Ca<sup>++</sup> levels. BMPR2i enhances Ca<sup>++</sup> uptake into the mitochondria induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by cancer therapeutics.

The BiKE:E5C1 exhibits high affinity/specificity for the CD16a activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on cancer cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BiKE:E5C1 can activate the NK cells and induce the killing of HER2+ ovarian and breast cancer cells, surpassing the performance of the best-in-class monoclonal antibody, Trazimera (trastuzumab). To advance this BiKE technology toward clinical application, the objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of BiKE:E5C1 to activate CD16+ immune cells such as NK cells and macrophages to kill cancer cells, and eradicate metastatic HER2+ tumors in NK humanized NOG mice. We assessed BiKE:E5C1's potential to activate CD16-expressing peripheral blood (PB)-NK cells, laNK92 cells, and THP-1-CD16A monocyte-macrophages through flowcytometry and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC) assays. Subsequently, laNK92 cells were selected as effector cells and genetically modified to express the nanoluciferase gene, enabling the monitoring of their viability in NK humanized NOG mice using quantitative bioluminescent imaging (qBLI). To evaluate the functionality of BiKE:E5C1 in vivo, we introduced firefly luciferase-expressing ovarian cancer cells via intraperitoneal injection into hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mice, creating a model of ovarian cancer metastasis. Once tumor establishment was confirmed, we treated the mice with laNK92 cells plus BiKE:E5C1 and the response to therapy was assessed using qBLI. Our data demonstrate that BiKE:E5C1 activates not only laNK92 cells but also PB-NK cells and macrophages, significantly enhancing their anticancer activities. ADCC assay demonstrated that IgG<sub>1</sub> Fc region had no impact on BiKE:E5C1's anticancer activity. In vivo results reveal that both hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mouse models support the viability and proliferation of laNK92 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that BiKE:E5C1 activates laNK92 cells in mice, leading to eradication of cancer metastasis in both NK humanized hIL-15 and hIL-2 NOG mouse models. Collectively, our in vivo findings underscore BiKE:E5C1's potential as an immune cell engager capable of activating immune cells for cancer cell elimination, thereby expanding the arsenal of available BiKEs for cancer immunotherapy.","Animals|Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity|Female|Humans|Killer Cells, Natural|Macrophages|Mice|Ovarian Neoplasms|Trastuzumab|antibodies, bispecific|cytotoxicity, immunologic","Khoshtinat Nikkhoi, Shahryar|Yang, Ge|Owji, Hajar|Grizotte-Lake, Mayara|Cohen, Rick I|Gil Gonzalez, Lazaro|Massumi, Mohammad|Hatefi, Arash",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2024,2024-03-15,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Although artificial intelligence applications have demonstrated notable success in predicting drug combination synergy, several key challenges persist: (1) Existing models often predict average synergy values across a restricted range of testing dosages, neglecting crucial dose amounts and the mechanisms of action of the drugs involved. (2) Many graph-based models rely on static protein-protein interactions, failing to adapt to dynamic and context-dependent networks. This limitation constrains the applicability of current methods. We introduced SAFER, a Sub-hypergraph Attention-based graph model, addressing these issues by incorporating complex relationships among biological knowledge networks and considering dosing effects on subject-specific networks. SAFER outperformed previous models on the benchmark and the independent test set. The analysis of subgraph attention weight for the lung cancer cell line highlighted JAK-STAT signaling pathway, PRDM12, ZNF781, and CDC5L that have been implicated in lung fibrosis. SAFER presents an interpretable framework designed to identify drug-responsive signals.

Here, we present Rolosense, a virus sensing platform that leverages the motion of 5 μm DNA-based motors on RNA fuel chips to transduce the presence of viruses. Motors and chips are modified with aptamers, which are designed for multivalent binding to viral targets and lead to stalling of motion. Therefore, the motors perform a ""mechanical test"" of the viral target and stall in the presence of whole virions, which represents a unique mechanism of transduction distinct from conventional assays. Rolosense can detect SARS-CoV-2 spiked in artificial saliva and exhaled breath condensate with a sensitivity of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL and discriminates among other respiratory viruses. The assay is modular and amenable to multiplexing, as demonstrated by our one-pot detection of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. As a proof of concept, we show that readout can be achieved using a smartphone camera with a microscopic attachment in as little as 15 min without amplification reactions.

Most research has been focused on how the two hormones regulate each other in terms of short-term pulses. Few studies have been conducted on the circadian relationship between the two hormones and how it differs between normal and abnormal groups. The circadian patterns are difficult to model as parametric functions. Directly extending univariate functional mixed effects models would result in a large dimensional problem and a challenging nonparametric inference. In this article, we propose a semi-parametric bivariate hierarchical state space model, in which each hormone profile is modeled by a hierarchical state space model, with nonparametric population-average and subject-specific components. The bivariate relationship is constructed by concatenating two latent independent subject-specific random functions specified by a design matrix, leading to a parametric inference on the correlation.

These records are crucial for enabling healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks and making better-informed decisions. This process contributes to reducing errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that incorporating instruction prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also leads to increased performance variance, resulting in significantly distinct summaries even when instruction prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a model-agnostic Soft Prompt-BasedCalibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft prompts to lower variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively regulates variance across different LLMs, providing a more consistent and reliable approach to summarizing critical medical information.",Calibration|Clinical research informatics|Data mining|Electronic Health Records|Health Personnel|Humans|Knowledge representation and information modeling|Language|Machine learning|Natural Language Processing|Natural language processing,"Chuang, Yu-Neng|Tang, Ruixiang|Jiang, Xiaoqian|Hu, Xia",Journal of biomedical informatics,2024,2024-03-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",LM013755,,,,,,U24,False,RADx-rad,Data Coordinating Center

This study compared the risk factors, symptoms, and outcomes of children and adults hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 2023 across age strata at 5 US sites participating in the Predicting Viral-Associated Inflammatory Disease Severity in Children with Laboratory Diagnostics and Artificial Intelligence consortium. Eligible patients had an upper respiratory swab that tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by nucleic acid amplification. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of clinical outcomes were determined for children versus adults, for pediatric age strata compared to adolescents (12-17 years), and for adult age strata compared to young adults (22-49 years). Of 9101 patients in the Predicting Viral-Associated Inflammatory Disease Severity in Children with Laboratory Diagnostics and Artificial Intelligence cohort, 1560 were hospitalized for COVID-19 as the primary reason. Compared to adults (22-105 years, n = 675), children (0-21 years, n = 885) were less commonly vaccinated (14.3% vs 34.5%), more commonly infected with the Omicron variant (49.5% vs 26.1%) and had fewer comorbidities (<i>P</i> < .001 for most comparisons), except for lung disease (<i>P</i> = .24). After adjusting for confounding variables, children had significantly lower odds of receiving supplemental oxygen (aOR, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, .35-.92) and death (aOR, 0.011; 95% confidence interval, <.01-.58) compa--red to adults. Among pediatric age strata, adolescents 12-17 years had the highest odds of receiving supplemental oxygen, high-flow oxygen, and ICU admission. Among adults, those 50-64 years had the highest odds of mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 differed across pediatric and adult age strata.

Radiologist annotations of mucus plugs were incorporated in an image-processing pipeline to generate size and location information that was related to measures of airflow.RESULTSThe length distribution of 778 annotated mucus plugs was multimodal, and a 12 mm length defined short (""stubby"", ≤12 mm) and long (""stringy"", >12 mm) plug phenotypes. High mucus plug burden was disproportionately attributable to stringy mucus plugs. Mucus plugs localized predominantly to airway generations 6-9, and 47% of plugs in baseline scans persisted in the same airway for 3 years and fluctuated in length and volume. Mucus plugs in larger proximal generations had greater effects on spirometry measures than plugs in smaller distal generations, and a model of airflow that estimates the increased airway resistance attributable to plugs predicted a greater effect for proximal generations and more numerous mucus plugs.CONCLUSIONPersistent mucus plugs in proximal airway generations occur in asthma and demonstrate a stochastic process of formation and resolution over time. Proximal airway mucus plugs are consequential for airflow and are in locations amenable to treatment by inhaled muco-active drugs or bronchoscopy.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov; NCT01718197, NCT01606826, NCT01750411, NCT01761058, NCT01761630, NCT01716494, and NCT01760915.FUNDINGAstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Genzyme-Regeneron, and TEVA provided financial support for study activities at the Coordinating and Clinical Centers beyond the third year of patient follow-up.

Salivary miRNA, in particular, stands out for its non-invasive collection method and ease of accessibility, offering promising avenues for the development of point-of-care diagnostics for a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Such development promises rapid and precise diagnosis, enabling timely treatment. Despite significant advancements in salivary miRNA-based testing, challenges persist in the quantification, multiplexing, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for miRNA at low concentrations in complex biological mixtures. This work delves into these challenges, focusing on the development and application of salivary miRNA tests for point-of-care use. We explore the biogenesis of salivary miRNA and analyze their quantitative expression and their disease relevance in cancer, infection, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also examined recent progress in miRNA extraction, amplification, and multiplexed detection methods.

However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis-resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR-Ms can transmigrate within a mico-fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment. The developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next-generation cardiovascular disease therapies and further studies include in vivo experiments.","Animals|Apoptosis|CAR macrophage|CD47 Antigen|Efferocytosis|Humans|Liposomes|Liver X Receptors|Macrophages|Mice|Nanoparticles|Reactive Oxygen Species|Receptors, Chimeric Antigen|Signal Transduction|atherosclerosis|efferocytosis|lipid nanoparticle|β‐cyclodextrin","Chuang, Skylar T|Stein, Joshua B|Nevins, Sarah|Kilic Bektas, Cemile|Choi, Hye Kyu|Ko, Wan-Kyu|Jang, Hyunjun|Ha, Jihun|Lee, Ki-Bum","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2024,2024-05-01,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
39248697,PMC11499710,doi:10.1002/sim.10192,Selection of number of clusters and warping penalty in clustering functional electrocardiogram.,"Clustering functional data aims to identify unique functional patterns in the entire domain, but this can be challenging due to phase variability that distorts the observed patterns. Curve registration can be used to remove this variability, but determining the appropriate level of warping flexibility can be complicated. Curve registration also requires a target to which a functional object is aligned, typically the cross-sectional mean of functional objects within the same cluster. However, this mean is unknown prior to clustering. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between flexible warping and the number of resulting clusters. Removing more phase variability through curve registration can lead to fewer remaining variations in the functional data, resulting in a smaller number of clusters. Thus, the optimal number of clusters and warping flexibility cannot be uniquely identified. We propose to use external information to solve the identification issue. We define a cross validated Kullback-Leibler information criterion to select the number of clusters and the warping penalty. The criterion is derived from the predictive classification likelihood considering the joint distribution of both the functional data and external variable and penalizes the uncertainty in the cluster membership. We evaluate our method through simulation and apply it to electrocardiographic data collected in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study. We identify two distinct clusters of electrocardiogram (ECG) profiles, with the second cluster exhibiting ST segment depression, an indication of cardiac ischemia, compared to the normal ECG profiles in the first cluster.",Algorithms|CRIC study|Cluster Analysis|Computer Simulation|Electrocardiography|Humans|Kullback‐Leibler information criterion|Likelihood Functions|classification likelihood|electrocardiogram|functional clustering,"Yang, Wei|Feldman, Harold I|Guo, Wensheng",Statistics in medicine,2024,2024-11-20,Journal Article,DK130067,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

The pre-metastatic niche (PMN) is a tissue microenvironment that has undergone changes to support the colonization and growth of circulating tumor cells, a key component of which is the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC). Therefore, the MDSC has been identified as a potential biomarker for PMN formation, the detection of which would enable clinicians to proactively treat metastases. However, there is currently no technology capable of the in situ detection of MDSCs available in the clinic. Here, we propose the use of shortwave infrared-emitting nanoprobes for the tracking of MDSCs and identification of the PMN. Our rare-earth albumin nanocomposites (ReANCs) are engineered to bind the Gr-1 surface marker of murine MDSCs. When delivered intravenously in murine models of breast cancer with high rates of metastasis, the targeted ReANCs demonstrated an increase in localization to the lungs in comparison to control ReANCs. However, no difference was seen in the model with slower rates of metastasis. This highlights the potential utility of MDSC-targeted nanoprobes to assess PMN development and prognosticate disease progression.",myeloid-derived suppressor cells|pre-metastatic niche|prognostication|rare-earth nanoprobes|shortwave infrared imaging,"Siebert, Jake N|Shah, Jay V|Tan, Mei Chee|Riman, Richard E|Pierce, Mark C|Lattime, Edmund C|Ganapathy, Vidya|Moghe, Prabhas V",Pharmaceutics,2024,2024-04-17,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

These peptides interact with two G-protein coupled receptors, orexin 1 (OX<sub>1</sub>) and orexin 2 (OX<sub>2</sub>) receptors which are capable of coupling to all heterotrimeric G-protein subfamilies, but primarily transduce increases in calcium signalling. Orexin neurons are regulated by a variety of transmitter systems and environmental stimuli that signal reward availability, including food and drug related cues. Orexin neurons are also activated by anticipation, stress, cues predicting motivationally relevant information, including those predicting drugs of abuse, and engage neuromodulatory systems, including dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to respond to these signals. As such, orexin neurons have been characterized as motivational activators that coordinate a range of functions, including feeding and arousal, that allow the individual to respond to motivationally relevant information, critical for survival. This review focuses on the role of orexins in appetitive motivation and highlights a role for these neuropeptides in pathologies characterized by inappropriately high levels of motivated arousal (overeating, anxiety and substance use disorders) versus those in which motivation is impaired (depression).",Animals|Humans|Hypothalamus|Motivation|Neuropeptides|Orexin Receptors|Orexins|addiction|dopamine|eating|mesolimbic system|nucleus accumbens|orexin hypocretin|orexin reserve|paraventricular nucleus|ventral tegmental area,"Mohammadkhani, Aida|Mitchell, Caitlin|James, Morgan H|Borgland, Stephanie L|Dayas, Christopher V",British journal of pharmacology,2024,2024-11-01,Journal Article|Review,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Mitochondrial translocation of miR-181c in cardiomyocytes results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during obesity. ROS causes Sp1, a transcription factor for MICU1, to be degraded via post-translational modification. The subsequent decrease in MICU1 expression causes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, ultimately leading to a propensity for heart failure. Herein, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Ser 387 (in human) or Ser 388 (in mouse) inhibits the translocation of miR-181c into the mitochondria by increasing the cytoplasmic stability of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Initially, estrogen offers cardioprotection in pre-menopausal females against the consequences of mitochondrial miR-181c upregulation by driving the phosphorylation of AGO2. Neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes (NMVM) treated with insulin showed an increase in pAGO2 levels and a decrease in mitochondrial miR-181c expression by increasing the binding affinity of AGO2-GW182 in the RISC. Thus, insulin treatment prevented excessive ROS production and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. In human cardiomyocytes, we overexpressed miR-181c to mimic pathological conditions, such as obesity/diabetes. Treatment with estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) for 48 h significantly lowered miR-181c entry into the mitochondria through increased pAGO2 levels. E<sub>2</sub> treatment also normalized Sp1 degradation and MICU1 transcription that normally occurs in response to miR-181c overexpression. We then investigated these findings using an in vivo model, with age-matched male, female and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Consistent with the E<sub>2</sub> treatment, we show that female hearts express higher levels of pAGO2 and thus, exhibit higher association of AGO2-GW182 in cytoplasmic RISC. This results in lower expression of mitochondrial miR-181c in female hearts compared to male or OVX groups. Further, female hearts had fewer consequences of mitochondrial miR-181c expression, such as lower Sp1 degradation and significantly decreased MICU1 transcriptional regulation. Taken together, this study highlights a potential therapeutic target for conditions such as obesity and diabetes, where miR-181c is upregulated. NEW AND NOTEWORTHY: In this study, we show that the phosphorylation of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) stabilizes the RNA-induced silencing complex in the cytoplasm, preventing miR-181c entry into the mitochondria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment with estradiol can inhibit the translocation of miR-181c into the mitochondria by phosphorylating AGO2. This ultimately eliminates the downstream consequences of miR-181c overexpression by mitigating excessive reactive oxygen species production and calcium entry into the mitochondria.","Animals|Argonaute Proteins|Calcium|Calcium-Binding Proteins|Cation Transport Proteins|Female|Gender differences|Heart|Humans|Insulin|Male|Mice|MicroRNAs|Mitochondria|Mitochondria, Heart|Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins|Mitochondrial microRNA|Myocytes, Cardiac|Obesity|Phosphorylation|RNA-Induced Silencing Complex|Reactive Oxygen Species|Sex Characteristics|Sp1 Transcription Factor|miR-181c","Quiroga, Diego|Roman, Barbara|Salih, Marwan|Daccarett-Bojanini, William N|Garbus, Haley|Ebenebe, Obialunanma V|Dodd-O, Jeffrey M|O'Rourke, Brian|Kohr, Mark|Das, Samarjit",Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2024,2024-09-01,Journal Article,TR003780,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Due to the high dilution of pathogens in sewage, a concentration method is often required to achieve reliable biomarker signals. However, most of the current concentration methods rely on expensive equipment and labor-intensive processes, which limits the application of WBE in low-resource settings. Here, we compared the performance of four inexpensive and simple concentration methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples: Solid Fraction, Porcine Gastric Mucin-conjugated Magnetic Beads, Calcium Flocculation-Citrate Dissolution (CFCD), and Nanotrap® Magnetic Beads (NMBs). The NMBs and CFCD methods yielded the highest concentration performance for SARS-CoV-2 (∼16-fold concentration and ∼ 41 % recovery) and require <45 min processing time. CFCD has a relatively low consumable cost (<$2 per four sample replicates).

One commonly estimated metric is the rate of change in pathogen quantity, which typically correlates with clinical surveillance in retrospective analyses. However, the accuracy of rate of change estimation approaches has not previously been evaluated. We assessed the performance of approaches for estimating rates of change in wastewater pathogen loads by generating synthetic wastewater time series data for which rates of change were known. Each approach was also evaluated on real-world data. Smooth trends and their first derivatives were jointly sampled from Gaussian processes (GP) and independent errors were added to generate synthetic viral load measurements; the range hyperparameter and error variance were varied to produce nine simulation scenarios representing different potential disease patterns. The directions and magnitudes of the rate of change estimates from four estimation approaches (two established and two developed in this work) were compared to the GP first derivative to evaluate classification and quantitative accuracy. Each approach was also implemented for public SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring data collected January 2021-May 2023 at 25 sites in North Carolina, USA. All four approaches inconsistently identified the correct direction of the trend given by the sign of the GP first derivative. Across all nine simulated disease patterns, between a quarter and a half of all estimates indicated the wrong trend direction, regardless of estimation approach.

To test the proposed model, a medium-sized university-led production batch of 30 wafers of chips were subjected to rigorous chemical performance testing. We quantitatively report the outcomes of each manufacturing process step leading to the final functional chemical sensor chip. We implemented a principal component analysis (PCA) model to score individual chip chemical performance, and we observed that the first two principal components represent 74.28% of chemical testing variance with 111 of 118 viable chips falling into the 95% confidence interval. Chemical performance scores and chip manufacturing data were analyzed using a multivariate regression model to determine the most influential manufacturing parameters and steps. In our analysis, we find the amount of sorbent mass present in the chip (variable importance score = 2.6) and heater and the RTD resistance values (variable importance score = 1.1) to be the manufacturing parameters with the greatest impact on chemical performance. Other non-obvious latent manufacturing parameters also had quantified influence. Statistical distributions for each manufacturing step will allow future large-scale production runs to be statistically sampled during production to perform QA/QC in a real-time environment.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), initially known for its effective nucleic acid detection abilities, presents itself as an attractive diagnostic strategy. CRISPR offers exceptional sensitivity, single-base specificity, and programmability. Here, we reviewed the latest developments in CRISPR-based POC devices and testing strategies for Mpox detection. We explored the crucial role of genetic sequencing in designing crRNA for CRISPR reaction and understanding Mpox transmission and mutations.

We consider a situation when we have time series data from multiple units that share similar patterns when aligned in terms of an internal time. The internal time is defined as an index according to evolving features of interest. When mapped back to the calendar time, these time series can span different time intervals that can include the future calendar time of the targeted unit, over which we can borrow the information from other units in forecasting the targeted unit. We first build a hierarchical state space model for the multiple time series data in terms of the internal time, where the shared components capture the similarities among different units while allowing for unit-specific deviations. A conditional state space model is then constructed to incorporate the information of existing units as the prior information in forecasting the targeted unit. By running the Kalman filtering based on the conditional state space model on the targeted unit, we incorporate both the information from the other units and the history of the targeted unit. The forecasts are then transformed from internal time back into calendar time for ease of interpretation. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance.

LDX treatment is generally effective at reducing binge eating symptoms but is associated with several unwanted side effects. How BED patients perceive the therapeutic efficacy vs. associated side effects of LDX has not been explored. We carried out a thematic analysis of 111 online reviews posted to the website Drugs. com by persons prescribed LDX to treat BED. We also explored how qualitative themes were associated with perceptions of treatment efficacy on a quantitative (1-10 scale) scale. Themes associated with higher efficacy ratings included improved binge eating outcomes, enhanced focus/concentration, as well as weight loss (χ<sup>2</sup> tests, p's < 0.05). Lower efficacy ratings were associated with themes that included tolerance to therapeutic effects of LDX, insomnia, return of binge eating in the evening, loss of energy in the afternoon/evening ('crashing'), and weight gain (χ<sup>2</sup> tests, p's < 0.05). Limitations of the study include representativeness of the data and self-reported BED diagnosis.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a field portable device (called MINI) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in wastewater using real-time reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time RT-LAMP). The device was tested using wastewater samples collected from buildings (with 430 to 1430 inhabitants) that had known COVID-19-positive cases. Results show comparable performance of RT-LAMP against reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) when detecting SARS-CoV-2 copies in wastewater. Both RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from buildings with at least three positive individuals within a 6-day time frame prior to diagnosis. The large 96-well throughput provided by MINI provided scalability to multi-building detection. The portability of the MINI device enabled decentralized on-site detection, significantly reducing the time to result.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers against the ancestral strain (WA1) and Omicron sublineages were evaluated in unvaccinated children admitted for COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 32) and MIS-C (<i>n</i> = 32) at the time of hospitalization (baseline) and at six to eight weeks post-discharge (follow-up) between 1 April 2020, and 1 September 2022. In addition, antibody binding to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) from WA1, BA.1, BA.2.75, and BA.4/BA.5 was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). At baseline, the children with MIS-C demonstrated two-fold to three-fold higher binding and neutralizing antibodies against ancestral WA1 compared to those with COVID-19. Importantly, in children with COVID-19, the virus neutralization titers against the Omicron subvariants at six to eight weeks post-discharge reached the same level as those with MIS-C had at baseline but were higher than titers at 6-8 weeks post-discharge for MIS-C cases. Cross-neutralization capacity against recently emerged Omicron BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1 variants was very low in children with either COVID-19 or MIS-C at all time points.

Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",Cell-based biosensor|Conditional protein splicing|Hippocalcin|Neural stem cell engineering|Neuronal differentiation|Non-invasive monitoring|Real-time monitoring|Split-intein,"Lee, Euiyeon|Choi, Hye Kyu|Kwon, Youngeun|Lee, Ki-Bum",Advanced functional materials,2024,2024-07-17,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

There are two main challenges in liver transplant: finding the best matching patient for a donor and ensuring transplant equity among different subpopulations. The current MELD scoring system evaluates a patient's mortality risk if not receiving an organ within 90 days. However, the donor-patient matching should also consider post-transplant risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic rejection, etc., which are all common complications after transplant. Accurate prediction of these risk scores remains a significant challenge. In this study, we used predictive models to solve the above challenges. Specifically, we proposed a deep learning model to predict multiple risk factors after a liver transplant. By formulating it as a multi-task learning problem, the proposed deep neural network was trained to simultaneously predict the five post-transplant risks and achieve equal good performance by exploiting task-balancing techniques. We also proposed a novel fairness-achieving algorithm to ensure prediction fairness across different subpopulations. We used electronic health records of 160,360 liver transplant patients, including demographic information, clinical variables, and laboratory values, collected from the liver transplant records of the United States from 1987 to 2018. The model's performance was evaluated using various performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC. Our experiment results highlighted the success of our multi-task model in achieving task balance while maintaining accuracy. The model significantly reduced the task discrepancy by 39 %. Further application of the fairness-achieving algorithm substantially reduced fairness disparity among all sensitive attributes (gender, age group, and race/ethnicity) in each risk factor. It underlined the potency of integrating fairness considerations into the task-balancing framework, ensuring robust and fair predictions across multiple tasks and diverse demographic groups.","Deep Learning|Fairness|Humans|Liver Transplantation|Liver transplantation|Multi-task learning|Neural Networks, Computer|Risk Factors|Risk prediction|Tissue Donors|United States","Li, Can|Jiang, Xiaoqian|Zhang, Kai",Journal of biomedical informatics,2024,2024-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",LM013755,,,,,,U24,False,RADx-rad,Data Coordinating Center

In this study, we endeavor to address both limitations through the utilization of DNA nanotechnology in LFA format, wherein we substitute the target-specific antibody with designer DNA nanostructure-based molecular probes for recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus via multivalent, pattern-matching interactions. We meticulously designed a Net-shaped DNA nanostructure and strategically arranged trimeric clusters of aptamers that specifically recognize the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

Our findings indicate high LFA sensitivity, enabling the detection of viral loads ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> viral copies/mL. This notable sensitivity is maintained across various SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, obviating the need for intricate sample preparation protocols. The significance of this heightened sensitivity lies in the crucial role played by the designer DNA nanostructure, which facilitates the detection of extremely low levels of viral loads.

To address this, we describe a generalizable bioinformatics-to-biology pipeline developed for the calibration and quality assurance of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 variant panels provided to Radical Acceleration of Diagnostics programs (RADx)-radical program awardees. A heuristic genetic analysis based on variant-defining mutations demonstrated the lowest genetic variance in the Nucleocapsid protein (Np)-C-terminal domain (CTD) across all SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then employed the Shannon entropy method on (Np) sequences collected from the major variants, verifying the CTD with lower entropy (less prone to mutations) than other Np regions. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against this target CTD antigen and used to develop an Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test for SARS-CoV-2. Blinded Viral Quality Assurance (VQA) panels comprised of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 variants (XBB.1.5, BF.7, BA.1, B.1.617.2, and WA1) and distractor respiratory viruses (CoV 229E, CoV OC43, RSV A2, RSV B, IAV H1N1, and IBV) were assembled by the RADx-rad Diagnostics core and tested using the ELISA described here. The assay tested positive for all variants with high sensitivity (limit of detection: 1.72-8.78 ng/mL) and negative for the distractor virus panel. Epitope mapping for the monoclonal antibodies identified a 20 amino acid antigenic peptide on the Np-CTD that an in-silico program also predicted for the highest antigenicity.

WWTP workers occupationally exposed to wastewater can be at risk of respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases. The study objectives were to: (1) quantify pathogens and pathogen indicators in wastewater aerosols near different WWTP processes/unit operations, (2) develop a QMRA model for multi-pathogen and multi-exposure pathway risks, and (3) create a web-based application to perform and communicate risk calculations for wastewater workers. Case studies for seven different WWTP job tasks were performed investigating infection risk across nine different enteric and respiratory pathogens. It was observed that the ingestion risk among job tasks was highest for ""walking the WWTP,"" which involved exposure from splashing, bioaerosols, and hand-to-mouth contact from touching contaminated surfaces. There was also a notable difference in exposure risk during peak (5:00am-9:00am) and non-peak hours (9:00am- 5:00am), with risks during the peak flow hours of the early morning assumed to be 5 times greater than non-peak hours. N95 respirator usage reduced median respiratory risks by 77 %. The developed tool performs multiple QMRA calculations to estimate WWTP workers' infection risks from accidental ingestion or inhalation of wastewater from multiple pathogens and exposure scenarios, which can inform risk management strategies to protect occupational health. However, more data are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates, including comparative data for pathogen concentrations in wastewater during peak and non-peak hours. QMRA tools will increase accessibility of risk models for utilization in decision-making.","Exposure modeling|Humans|Models, Theoretical|Occupational Exposure|Pathogenic microorganisms & exposure|Public health|Risk Assessment|Sewage|Waste Disposal, Fluid|Wastewater|Water Purification|Workplace exposures","Heida, Ashley|Maal-Bared, Rasha|Veillette, Marc|Duchaine, Caroline|Reynolds, Kelly A|Ashraf, Ahamed|Ogunseye, Olusola O|Jung, Yoonhee|Shulman, Lester|Ikner, Luisa|Betancourt, Walter|Hamilton, Kerry A|Wilson, Amanda M",Water research,2024,2024-08-15,Journal Article,DA053976,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Between April 5, 2021, and July 5, 2022, 1,979 individuals took one SCENTinel® test, completed at least one physician-ordered SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and endorsed a list of self-reported symptoms. Among the of SCENTinel® subtests, the self-rated odor intensity score, especially when dichotomized using a previously established threshold, was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SCENTinel® had high specificity and negative predictive value, indicating that those who passed SCENTinel® likely did not have a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Predictability of the SCENTinel® performance was stronger when the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was dominant rather than when the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was dominant. Additionally, SCENTinel® predicted SARS-CoV-2 positivity better than using a self-reported symptom checklist alone. These results indicate that SCENTinel® is a rapid assessment tool that can be used for population-level screening to monitor abrupt changes in olfactory function, and to evaluate spread of viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 that often have smell loss as a symptom.",Adult|Aged|COVID|COVID-19|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Odorants|Olfaction Disorders|Predictive Value of Tests|SARS-CoV-2|Sensitivity and Specificity|Young Adult|anosmia|hyposmia|olfaction|pandemic|prediction|testing,"Hunter, Stephanie R|Zola, Anne|Ho, Emily|Kallen, Michael|Adjei-Danquah, Edith|Achenbach, Chad|Smith, G Randy|Gershon, Richard|Reed, Danielle R|Schalet, Benjamin|Parma, Valentina|Dalton, Pamela H",Frontiers in public health,2024,2024-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

38007143,PMC10872724,doi:10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122289,A hypothesis: Potential contributions of metals to the pathogenesis of pulmonary artery hypertension.,"Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is characterized by vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling resulting in both increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The chronic and high-pressure stress experienced by endothelial cells can give rise to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. However, there is no clearly defined mechanism for PAH and available treatment options only provide limited symptomatic relief. Due to the far-reaching effects of metal exposures, the interaction between metals and the pulmonary vasculature is of particular interest. This review will briefly introduce the pathophysiology of PAH and then focus on the potential roles of metals, including essential and non-essential metals in the pathogenic process in the pulmonary arteries and right heart, which may be linked to PAH. Based on available data from human studies of occupational or environmental metal exposure, including lead, antimony, iron, and copper, the hypothesis of metals contributing to the pathogenesis of PAH is proposed as potential risk factors and underlying mechanisms for PAH. We propose that metals may initiate or exacerbate the pathogenesis of PAH, by providing potential mechanism by which metals interact with hypoxia-inducible factor and tumor suppressor p53 to modulate their downstream cellular proliferation pathways. These need further investigation. Additionally, we present future research directions on roles of metals in PAH.","Endothelial Cells|Heavy metals|Humans|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Mineral homeostasis|Non-essential metals|Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|Pulmonary Artery|Pulmonary hypertension|Pulmonary hypoxia|Right ventricle dysfunction|Trace elements|Vascular Remodeling","Hopkins, C Danielle|Wessel, Caitlin|Chen, Oscar|El-Kersh, Karim|Cathey, Dakotah|Cave, Matthew C|Cai, Lu|Huang, Jiapeng",Life sciences,2024,2024-01-01,Journal Article|Review,TR003787,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

However, the potential application of anti-HER2 VHHs as a diagnostic tool suitable for ELISA, flow cytometry, cell imaging, bispecific antibody engineering, and immunohistochemistry has not been fully elucidated. To investigate this potential, HER2 antigen was expressed in HEK293 F cells, purified, and used to immunize llama. Using phage display, anti-HER2 VHHs with high affinity and specificity were isolated, sequenced, and constructed with a Histag and c-Myc tag. The constructed anti-HER2 VHHs were then expressed in E. coli, purified, and evaluated for their use in ELISA, flow cytometry, cell imaging, and immunohistochemistry. The affinities of the anti-HER2 VHHs toward the HER2 antigen were determined using biolayer interferometry. Furthermore, the binding sites of the anti-HER2 VHHs were evaluated by epitope mapping and in silico modeling and docking. Here, we report the sequence of an anti-HER2 VHH with high affinity (sub-nanomolar), specificity, and selectivity. This VHH binds to the same epitope as trastuzumab and can be utilized to generate bispecific antibodies or used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate HER2<sup>+</sup> from HER2<sup>-</sup> antigens on plates, cells, and tissues.

The ability to control and investigated macrophage inflammatory responses at the implant-macrophage interface would be critical for reducing chronic inflammation and improving tissue integration. Nonetheless, the systematic investigation of how surface topography affects macrophage polarization is typically complicated by the restricted complexity of accessible nanostructures, difficulties in achieving exact control, and biased preselection of experimental parameters. In response to these problems, we developed a large-scale, high-content combinatorial biophysical cue (CBC) array for enabling high-throughput screening (HTS) of the effects of nanotopography on macrophage polarization and subsequent inflammatory processes. Our CBC array, created utilizing the dynamic laser interference lithography (DLIL) technology, contains over 1 million nanotopographies, ranging from nanolines and nanogrids to intricate hierarchical structures with dimensions ranging from 100 nm to several microns. Using machine learning (ML) based on the Gaussian process regression algorithm, we successfully identified certain topographical signals that either repress (pro-M2) or stimulate (pro-M1) macrophage polarization. The upscaling of these nanotopographies for further examination has shown mechanisms such as cytoskeletal remodeling and ROCK-dependent epigenetic activation to be critical to the mechanotransduction pathways regulating macrophage fate. Thus, we have also developed a platform combining advanced DLIL nanofabrication techniques, HTS, ML-driven prediction of nanobio interactions, and mechanotransduction pathway evaluation. In short, our developed platform technology not only improves our ability to investigate and understand nanotopography-regulated macrophage inflammatory responses but also holds great potential for guiding the design of nanostructured coatings for therapeutic biomaterials and biomedical implants.",Animals|Machine Learning|Macrophages|Mice|Nanostructures|RAW 264.7 Cells|Surface Properties|combinatorial biophysical cues|epigenetic modulation|high-throughput screening|immunomodulation|machine-learning-driven analysis|nanotopography-mediated macrophage polarization,"Hou, Yannan|Conklin, Brandon|Choi, Hye Kyu|Yang, Letao|Lee, Ki-Bum",ACS nano,2024,2024-09-17,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The study population consisted of 72 post-COVID-19 individuals and 11 non-COVID-19 infected participants in the control group. The participants were recruited from adult hospitals and from the community. The enrollment started in October 2020 and follow-up periods were at 3, 6, and 12 months from their initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The participants were interviewed for medical and COVID-19 infection history. Samples of white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer were taken at each visit. Certified sonographers performed vascular ultrasound on the study participants. Median intima-media thickness (IMT) was increased in mild/asymptomatic (0.80 mm) and severe/critical (0.90 mm) groups when compared with controls (0.60 mm; <i>P</i> < .001 for both groups). In the asymptomatic/mild group, 6-month median IMT (0.88 mm) was increased, compared with the 3-month group (0.75 mm), with <i>P</i> = .026. Increased age was associated with decreased mean arterial blood velocities (cm/s): common carotid (<i>r</i> = -0.236, <i>P</i> = .032), internal carotid (<i>r</i> = -0.208, <i>P</i> = .048), and subclavian artery mean velocity (<i>r</i> = -0.357, <i>P</i> = .003). We did not find any instance of deep vein thrombosis. Median D-dimer, CRP, and WBC in the control group differed from asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 group (<i>P</i> = .026, .011, and .003, respectively).

The selection of analgesic and sedative medications during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of these sedation practices on patient outcomes, remain incompletely characterized. What were the hospital patterns of analgesic and sedative use for patients with COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation (MV), and what differences in clinical patient outcomes were observed across prevailing sedation practices? We conducted an observational cohort study of hospitalized adults who received MV for COVID-19 from February 2020 through April 2021 within the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS) COVID-19 Registry. To describe common sedation practices, we used hierarchical clustering to group hospitals based on the percentage of patients who received various analgesic and sedative medications. We then used multivariable regression models to evaluate the association between hospital analgesia and sedation cluster and duration of MV (with a placement of death [POD] approach to account for competing risks). We identified 1,313 adults across 35 hospitals admitted with COVID-19 who received MV. Two clusters of analgesia and sedation practices were identified. Cluster 1 hospitals generally administered opioids and propofol with occasional use of additional sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines, alpha-agonists, and ketamine); cluster 2 hospitals predominantly used opioids and benzodiazepines without other sedatives. As compared with patients in cluster 2, patients admitted to cluster 1 hospitals underwent a shorter adjusted median duration of MV with POD (β-estimate, -5.9; 95% CI, -11.2 to -0.6; <i>P</i> = .03).

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to severe disease are poorly understood. This study leveraged clinical samples from a well-characterized cohort of children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C to compare immune-mediated biomarkers. Our objective was to identify selected immune molecules that could explain, in part, why certain SARS-CoV-2-infected children developed MIS-C. We hypothesized that type-2 helper T cell-mediated inflammation can elicit autoantibodies, which may account for some of the differences observed between the moderate-severe COVID-19 (COVID<sup>+</sup>) and MIS-C cohort. We enumerated blood leukocytes and measured levels of selected serum cytokines, chemokines, antibodies to COVID-19 antigens, and autoantibodies in children presenting to an academic medical center in Connecticut, United States. The neutrophil/lymphocyte and eosinophil/lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in those in the MIS-C versus COVID<sup>+</sup> cohort. IgM and IgA, but not IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain were significantly higher in the MIS-C cohort than the COVID<sup>+</sup> cohort. The serum levels of certain type-2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-33) were significantly higher in children with MIS-C compared to the COVID<sup>+</sup> and SARS-CoV-2-negative cohorts. IgG autoantibodies to brain antigens and pentraxin were higher in children with MIS-C compared to SARS-CoV-19-negative controls, and children with MIS-C had higher levels of IgG anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (caspr2) compared to the COVID<sup>+</sup> and SARS-CoV-19-negative controls. We speculate that autoimmune responses in certain COVID-19 patients may induce pathophysiological changes that lead to MIS-C.

Meanwhile, the rise of CRC in younger adults (Early-onset CRC), commonly diagnosed with a metastatic form of the disease, shows the pressing need to develop more effective targeted therapies to decrease the high mortality rates associated with metastatic disease. Hyperactivation of the Rictor-mTORC2-AKT signaling pathway drives key metastatic players in diverse malignant tumors, including early- and late-onset colorectal cancer. Selective mTORC2 inhibitors are becoming a potential treatment strategy for CRC due to the therapeutic limitations of mTORC1 inhibitors. Veratridine (VTD), a lipid-soluble alkaloid extracted from Liliaceae plants, can transcriptionally increase UBXN2A, which induces 26S proteasomal degradation of the Rictor protein, a key member in the mTORC2 complex. Destabilization of Rictor protein by VTD decreases Akt phosphorylation on Ser<sup>473</sup>, which is responsible for metastatic signaling downstream of the mTORC2 pathway in diverse malignant tumors. VTD decreases the population of metastatic colon cancer stem cells and functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor. VTD effectively reduces the spheroid growth rate and restricts cell migration. Live cell migration and invasion assays alongside biomechanical-force-based experiments revealed that VTD suppresses colon cancer cell invasiveness and the ensuing risk of tumor metastasis. A CRC mouse model that mimics the natural stages of human sporadic CRC revealed that VTD treatment significantly decreases tumor growth in a UBXN2A-dependent manner. This study showed a novel mechanistic connection between a ubiquitin-like protein and mTORC2-dependent migration and invasion in CRC tumors. This study revealed the therapeutic benefit of selective inhibition of Rictor in CRC, particularly in tumors with a hyperactive Rictor-mTORC2 signaling pathway.

The aim of this study was to compare wastewater detection of xylazine with other public health and safety surveillance data from 2019 to 2023 in Kentucky. Wastewater samples from 5 rest areas, 2 truck weigh stations, and 4 wastewater treatment plants were tested for xylazine. Wastewater xylazine positivity rates were compared with xylazine-positive submission rates from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System and Kentucky's fatal overdoses in 6-month periods (Period 1=January-June; Period 2=July-December). Xylazine was detected in 61.6% (424 of 688) of daily wastewater samples from roadway sites/wastewater treatment plants. For roadways, detection increased from 55% (Period 1, 2021) to 94% (Period 1, 2023), and wastewater treatment plants had an overall detection of 25.8% (<i>n</i>=66 samples, Periods 1 and 2, 2022).

Here we investigate the molecular role and clinical significance of intelectin-1 (ITLN-1) in the development of pathologic airway mucus in asthma. Through analyses of human airway epithelial cells we find that ITLN1 gene expression is highly induced by interleukin-13 (IL-13) in a subset of metaplastic MUC5AC<sup>+</sup> mucus secretory cells, and that ITLN-1 protein is a secreted component of IL-13-induced mucus. Additionally, we find ITLN-1 protein binds the C-terminus of the MUC5AC mucin and that its deletion in airway epithelial cells partially reverses IL-13-induced mucostasis. Through analysis of nasal airway epithelial brushings, we find that ITLN1 is highly expressed in T2-high asthmatics, when compared to T2-low children. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both ITLN-1 gene expression and protein levels are significantly reduced by a common genetic variant that is associated with protection from the formation of mucus plugs in T2-high asthma. This work identifies an important biomarker and targetable pathways for the treatment of mucus obstruction in asthma.","Asthma|Child|Cytokines|Epithelial Cells|GPI-Linked Proteins|Humans|Interleukin-13|Lectins|Mucin 5AC|Mucus|Nasal Mucosa|Polymorphism, Genetic|Respiratory Mucosa","Everman, Jamie L|Sajuthi, Satria P|Liegeois, Maude A|Jackson, Nathan D|Collet, Erik H|Peters, Michael C|Chioccioli, Maurizio|Moore, Camille M|Patel, Bhavika B|Dyjack, Nathan|Powell, Roger|Rios, Cydney|Montgomery, Michael T|Eng, Celeste|Elhawary, Jennifer R|Mak, Angel C Y|Hu, Donglei|Huntsman, Scott|Salazar, Sandra|Feriani, Luigi|Fairbanks-Mahnke, Ana|Zinnen, Gianna L|Michel, Cole R|Gomez, Joe|Zhang, Xing|Medina, Vivian|Chu, Hong Wei|Cicuta, Pietro|Gordon, Erin D|Zeitlin, Pamela|Ortega, Victor E|Reisdorph, Nichole|Dunican, Eleanor M|Tang, Monica|Elicker, Brett M|Henry, Travis S|Bleecker, Eugene R|Castro, Mario|Erzurum, Serpil C|Israel, Elliot|Levy, Bruce D|Mauger, David T|Meyers, Deborah A|Sumino, Kaharu|Gierada, David S|Hastie, Annette T|Moore, Wendy C|Denlinger, Loren C|Jarjour, Nizar N|Schiebler, Mark L|Wenzel, Sally E|Woodruff, Prescott G|Rodriguez-Santana, Jose|Pearson, Chad G|Burchard, Esteban G|Fahy, John V|Seibold, Max A",Nature communications,2024,2024-05-09,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

They have garnered increasing attention because of their potential for both the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The diversity of sEVs derives from their biological composition and cargo content. Currently, the isolation of sEV subpopulations is primarily based on bio-physical and affinity-based approaches. Since a standardized definition for sEV subpopulations is yet to be fully established, it is important to further investigate the correlation between the biomolecular composition of sEVs and their physical properties. In this study, we employed a platform combining single-vesicle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning to examine individual sEVs isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The biomolecular composition of each vesicle examined was reflected by its corresponding SERS spectral features (biomolecular ""fingerprints""), with their roots in the composition of their collective Raman-active bonds. Origins of the SERS spectral features were validated through a comparative analysis between SERS and mass spectrometry (MS). SERS fingerprinting of individual vesicles was effective in overcoming the challenges posed by EV population averaging, allowing for the possibility of analyzing the variations in biomolecular composition between the vesicles of similar and/or different sizes. Using this approach, we uncovered that each of the size-based fractions of sEVs contained particles with predominantly similar SERS spectral features. Indeed, more than 84% of the vesicles residing within a particular group were clearly distinguishable from that of the other EV sub-populations, despite some spectral variations within each sub-population. Our results suggest the possibility that size-based EV fractionation methods produce samples where similarly eluted sEVs are correlated with their respective biochemical contents, as reflected by their SERS spectra. Our findings therefore highlight the possibility that the biogenesis and respective biological functionalities of the various sEV fractions may be inherently different.","Chromatography, Gel|Extracellular Vesicles|Humans|Machine Learning|Mass Spectrometry|Spectrum Analysis, Raman","Liu, Zirui|Ng, Martin|Srivastava, Siddharth|Li, Tieyi|Liu, Jun|Phu, Tuan Anh|Mateescu, Bogdan|Wang, Yi-Ting|Tsai, Chia-Feng|Liu, Tao|Raffai, Robert L|Xie, Ya-Hong",PloS one,2024,2024-01-01,Journal Article,TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

College students had to contend with clinical testing while simultaneously dealing with health risks and the academic pressures brought on by quarantines, changes to virtual platforms, and other disruptions to daily life. The objective of this study was to analyze whether wastewater surveillance can be used to decrease the intensity of clinical testing while maintaining reliable measurements of diseases incidence on campus. Twelve months of human health and wastewater surveillance data for eight residential buildings on a university campus were analyzed to establish how SARS-CoV-2 levels in the wastewater can be used to minimize clinical testing burden on students. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels were used to create multiple scenarios, each with differing levels of testing intensity, which were compared to the actual testing volumes implemented by the university. We found that scenarios in which testing intensity fluctuations matched rise and falls in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels had stronger correlations between SARS-CoV-2 levels and recorded clinical positives. In addition to stronger correlations, most scenarios resulted in overall fewer weekly clinical tests performed. We suggest the use of wastewater surveillance to guide COVID-19 testing as it can significantly increase the efficacy of COVID-19 surveillance while reducing the burden placed on college students during a pandemic.

As the public health emergency has ended, researchers and practitioners are looking to shift the focus of existing wastewater surveillance programs to other targets, including bacteria. Bacterial targets may pose some unique challenges for WBE applications. To explore the current state of the field, the National Science Foundation-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) on Wastewater Based Epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Public Health Threats held a workshop in April 2023 to discuss the challenges and needs for wastewater bacterial surveillance. The targets and methods used in existing programs were diverse, with twelve different targets and nine different methods listed. Discussions during the workshop highlighted the challenges in adapting existing programs and identified research gaps in four key areas: choosing new targets, relating bacterial wastewater data to human disease incidence and prevalence, developing methods, and normalizing results. To help with these challenges and research gaps, the authors identified steps the larger community can take to improve bacteria wastewater surveillance. This includes developing data reporting standards and method optimization and validation for bacterial programs. Additionally, more work is needed to understand shedding patterns for potential bacterial targets to better relate wastewater data to human infections. Wastewater surveillance for bacteria can help provide insight into the underlying prevalence in communities, but much work is needed to establish these methods.IMPORTANCEWastewater surveillance was a useful tool to elucidate the burden and spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic.

In this study, we explored the engineering of a tetravalent BiKE by fusing two anti-CD16a and two anti-HER2 VHHs in tandem, using bivalent BiKE as a template. The tetravalent BiKE was genetically engineered, and its tertiary structure was predicted using in silico modeling. The antigen binding and affinity of the tetravalent BiKE were assessed using ELISA, flow cytometry, and biolayer interferometry. The ability of the BiKEs to kill cancer cells was evaluated through classical and residual antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. Additionally, we investigated the potential for NK cell fratricide via CD16a-CD16a crosslinking. Our results revealed that the tetravalent BiKE exhibited at least 100-fold higher affinity toward its target antigens compared to its bivalent counterpart. The residual ADCC assay indicated that the tetravalent BiKE was more effective in killing cancer cells than the bivalent BiKE, attributable to its lower K<sub>off</sub> value, which prolonged its binding to NK cell surfaces. Fratricide assays demonstrated that neither the bivalent nor the tetravalent BiKE mediated fratricide. Notably, our findings showed that daratumumab-induced NK fratricide was restricted to CD38-CD38 crosslinking and was not related to ADCC via CD16a-CD38 crosslinking.

The resulting AT segment score (0-19) was related to patient outcomes. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> AT varied at the lung segment level and tended to persist at the patient and lung segment levels over 3 years. Patients with widespread AT (⩾10 segments) had more severe asthma (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The mean (±SD) AT segment score in patients with a body mass index ⩾30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was lower than in patients with a body mass index <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (3.5 ± 4.6 vs. 5.5 ± 6.3; <i>P</i> = 0.008), and the frequency of AT in lower lobe segments in obese patients was less than in upper and middle lobe segments (35% vs. 46%; <i>P</i> = 0.001). The AT segment score in patients with sputum eosinophils ⩾2% was higher than in patients without sputum eosinophilia (7.0 ± 6.1 vs. 3.3 ± 4.9; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Lung segments with AT more frequently had airway mucus plugging than lung segments without AT (48% vs. 18%; <i>P</i> ⩽ 0.0001). <b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with asthma, air trapping is more severe in those with airway eosinophilia and mucus plugging, whereas those who are obese have less severe trapping because their lower lobe segments are spared.","Adult|Aged|Asthma|Body Mass Index|Eosinophilia|Female|Humans|Lung|Male|Middle Aged|Obesity|Tomography, X-Ray Computed|air trapping segment score|asthma|computed tomography|eosinophils|obesity","Leung, Clarus|Tang, Monica|Huang, Brendan K|Fain, Sean B|Hoffman, Eric A|Choi, Jiwoong|Dunican, Eleanor M|Mauger, David T|Denlinger, Loren C|Jarjour, Nizar N|Israel, Elliot|Levy, Bruce D|Wenzel, Sally E|Sumino, Kaharu|Hastie, Annette T|Schirm, Joshua|McCulloch, Charles E|Peters, Michael C|Woodruff, Prescott G|Sorkness, Ronald L|Castro, Mario|Fahy, John V",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2024,2024-05-15,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Because of antigenic drift, influenza vaccines are frequently updated, though their efficacy may still be limited due to strain mismatches. Despite the high levels of viral diversity observed across populations, most human studies reveal limited intrahost diversity, leaving the origin of population-level viral diversity unclear. Previous studies show host characteristics, such as immunity, might affect within-host viral evolution. Here we investigate influenza A viral diversity in children aged between 6 months and 18 years. Influenza virus evolution in children is less well characterized than in adults, yet may be associated with higher levels of viral diversity given the lower level of pre-existing immunity and longer durations of infection in children. We obtained influenza isolates from banked influenza A-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the 2017-18 influenza season. Using next-generation sequencing, we evaluated the population of influenza viruses present in each sample. We characterized within-host viral diversity using the number and frequency of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) detected in each sample. We related viral diversity to clinical metadata, including subjects' age, vaccination status, and comorbid conditions, as well as sample metadata such as virus strain and cycle threshold. Consistent with previous studies, most samples contained low levels of diversity with no clear association between the subjects' age, vaccine status, or health status. Further, there was no enrichment of iSNVs near known antigenic sites.

Prostate cancer tumors display highly glycolytic phenotypes as the cancer progresses. Nonspecific inhibitors of glycolysis have not been utilized successfully for chemotherapy, because of their penchant to cause systemic toxicity. This study reports the preclinical activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a novel small-molecule preclinical candidate, BKIDC-1553, with antiglycolytic activity. We tested a large battery of prostate cancer cell lines for inhibition of cell proliferation, in vitro. Cell-cycle, metabolic, and enzymatic assays were used to demonstrate their mechanism of action. A human patient-derived xenograft model implanted in mice and a human organoid were studied for sensitivity to our BKIDC preclinical candidate. A battery of pharmacokinetic experiments, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion experiments, and in vitro and in vivo toxicology experiments were carried out to assess readiness for clinical trials. We demonstrate a new class of small-molecule inhibitors where antiglycolytic activity in prostate cancer cell lines is mediated through inhibition of hexokinase 2. These compounds display selective growth inhibition across multiple prostate cancer models. We describe a lead BKIDC-1553 that demonstrates promising activity in a preclinical xenograft model of advanced prostate cancer, equivalent to that of enzalutamide. BKIDC-1553 demonstrates safety and pharmacologic properties consistent with a compound that can be taken into human studies with expectations of a good safety margin and predicted dosing for efficacy.

38873842,PMC11409400,doi:10.1002/mp.17253,Investigating the potential of catheter-assisted pulsed focused ultrasound ablation for atherosclerotic plaques.,"Atherosclerosis is a condition in which an adhesive substance called plaque accumulates over time inside the arteries. Plaque buildup results in the constriction of arteries, causing a shortage of blood supply to tissues and organs. Removing atherosclerotic plaques controls the development of acute ischemic stroke and heart diseases. It remains imperative for positive patient outcomes. This study sought to develop a minimally invasive technique for removing arterial plaques by applying focused ultrasound (FUS) energy on the metal surface of a nitinol catheter wire to induce inertial cavitation. The induced cavitation can deplete plaque mechanically inside the arteries, leading towards improved recanalization of blood vessels. The enhanced cavitation effect induced by combining FUS with a metal catheter was first verified by exposing agar phantom gels with or without a 0.9-mm diameter nitinol wire to an acoustic field produced by a 0.5-MHz FUS transducer. The phenomenon was further confirmed in pork belly fat samples with or without a 3-mm diameter nitinol catheter wire. Cavitation was monitored by detecting the peaks of emitted ultrasound signals from the samples using a passive cavitation detector (PCD). Cavitation threshold values were determined by observing the jump in the peak amplitude of signals received by the PCD when the applied FUS peak negative pressure (PNP) increased. To simulate arterial plaque removal, FUS with or without a catheter was used to remove tissues from pork belly fat samples and the lipid cores of human atherosclerotic plaque samples using 2500-cycle FUS bursts at 10% duty cycle and a burst repetition rate of 20 Hz. Treatment outcomes were quantified by subtracting the weight of samples before treatment from the weight of samples after treatment. All measurements were repeated 5 times (n = 5) unless otherwise indicated, and paired t-tests were used to compare the means of two groups. A p-value of <0.05 will be considered significant. Our results showed that with a nitinol wire, the cavitation threshold in agar phantoms was reduced to 2.6 MPa from 4.3 MPa PNP when there was no nitinol wire in the focal region of FUS. For pork belly fat samples, cavitation threshold values were 1.0 and 2.0 MPa PNP, with and without a catheter wire, respectively. Pork belly fat tissues and lipid cores of atherosclerotic plaques were depleted at the interface between a catheter and the samples at 2 and 4 MPa FUS PNP, respectively. The results showed that with a catheter wire in the focal region of a 3-min FUS treatment session, 24.7 and 25.6 mg of lipid tissues were removed from pork belly fat and human atherosclerotic samples, respectively.

To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased <i>CLEC9A+</i> dendritic cell and <i>CLEC7A/SYK</i> expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

However, challenges in separating EVs from soluble proteins have resulted in variable EV recovery rates and low purities. Here, we report a high-yield ( > 90%) and rapid ( < 10 min) EV isolation method called FLocculation via Orbital Acoustic Trapping (FLOAT). The FLOAT approach utilizes an acoustofluidic droplet centrifuge to rotate and controllably heat liquid droplets. By adding a thermoresponsive polymer flocculant, nanoparticles as small as 20 nm can be rapidly and selectively concentrated at the center of the droplet. We demonstrate the ability of FLOAT to separate urinary EVs from the highly abundant Tamm-Horsfall protein, addressing a significant obstacle in the development of EV-based liquid biopsies.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has traditionally relied on evaluation of clinical symptoms for cognitive impairment with a definitive diagnosis requiring post-mortem demonstration of neuropathology. However, advances in disease pathogenesis have revealed that patients exhibit Alzheimer's disease pathology several decades before the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

While these devices have played a significant role in alleviating the burden on the public healthcare system, their specificity and sensitivity fall short compared with molecular tests. In this study, we endeavor to address both limitations through the utilization of DNA nanotechnology in LFA format, wherein we substitute the target-specific antibody with designer DNA nanostructure-based molecular probes for recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus via multivalent, pattern-matching interactions. We meticulously designed a Net-shaped DNA nanostructure and strategically arranged trimeric clusters of aptamers that specifically recognize the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. This approach has proven instrumental in bolstering virus-binding affinity on the LFAs. Our findings indicate high LFA sensitivity, enabling the detection of viral loads ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> viral copies/mL. This notable sensitivity is maintained across various SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, obviating the need for intricate sample preparation protocols. The significance of this heightened sensitivity lies in the crucial role played by the designer DNA nanostructure, which facilitates the detection of extremely low levels of viral loads. This not only enhances the overall reliability of self-testing but also reduces the likelihood of false-negative results, especially in cases of low viral load within patient samples.",COVID-19|DNA|Humans|Nanostructures|Pandemics|Reproducibility of Results|SARS-CoV-2|Sensitivity and Specificity,"Umrao, Saurabh|Zheng, Mengxi|Jin, Xiaohe|Yao, Sherwood|Wang, Xing",Analytical chemistry,2024,2024-02-27,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Methods The primary outcome was weekly study enrollments analyzed using a run chart. A secondary analysis used linear regression to assess study enrollments two days before and after a social media post, adjusted for the statewide pediatric seven-day-average severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case rate, social media posting day, and the interaction of these two variables. Results In seven months before social media posting, only eight patients were enrolled. One week after social media posting began, the median weekly enrollment increased (0 to 3). In the regression model, neither social media post day nor the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 case rate was significantly associated with enrollment rate. However, the interaction of a post day and the pediatric case rate was significant. Conclusion Social media posts significantly increased enrollment among children with mild COVID-19 in a prospective study.

A Critical Review.,"The decision to perform biventricular repair (BVR) in neonates and infants presenting with either single or multiple left ventricle outflow obstructions (LVOTOs) and a borderline left ventricle (BLV) is subject to extensive discussion, and limited information is known regarding the long-term outcomes. As a result, the objective of this study is to critically assess and summarize the available data regarding the prognosis of neonates and infants with LVOTO and BLV who underwent BVR. In February 2023, we conducted a review study with three different medical search engines (the National Library of Medicine, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library) for Medical Subject Headings and free text terms including ""congenital heart disease"", ""outcome"", and ""borderline left ventricle"". The search was refined by adding keywords for ""Shone's complex"", ""complex LVOT obstruction"", ""hypoplastic left heart syndrome/complex"", and ""critical aortic stenosis"". Out of a total of 51 studies, 15 studies were included in the final analysis. The authors utilized heterogeneous definitions to characterize BLV, resulting in considerable variation in inclusion criteria among studies. Three distinct categories of studies were identified, encompassing those specifically designed to evaluate BLV, those focused on Shone's complex, and finally those on aortic stenosis. Despite the challenges associated with comparing data originating from slightly different cardiac defects and from different eras, our results indicate a favorable survival rate and clinical outcome following BVR. However, the incidence of reintervention remains high, and concerns persist regarding residual pulmonary hypertension, which has been inadequately investigated. The available data concerning neonates and infants with LVOTO and BLV who undergo BVR are inadequate and fragmented. Consequently, large-scale studies are necessary to fully ascertain the long-term outcome of these complex defects.",cardiac surgery|congenital heart disease|pediatric,"Cantinotti, Massimiliano|Jani, Vivek|Kutty, Shelby|Marchese, Pietro|Franchi, Eliana|Pizzuto, Alessandra|Viacava, Cecilia|Assanta, Nadia|Santoro, Giuseppe|Giordano, Raffaele","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,2024-01-30,Journal Article|Review,HD105591,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

NKCEs offer a significant advancement over conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by enhancing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). They achieve this by stably and selectively binding to both NK cell activating receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Unlike traditional mAbs, which depend on the relatively transient interaction between their Fc region and CD16a, NKCEs establish more robust connections with a range of activating receptors (e.g., CD16a, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, NKG2C) and inhibitory receptors (e.g., Siglec-7) on NK cells, thereby increasing cancer cell killing efficacy and specificity. This review article critically examines the strategies for engineering bi-, tri-, and multi-specific NKCEs for cancer immunotherapy, providing an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements in NKCE platform technologies currently under development by pharmaceutical and biotech companies and discussing the preclinical and clinical progress of these products. While NKCEs show great promise, the review underscores the need for continued research to optimize their therapeutic efficacy and to overcome obstacles related to NK cell functionality in cancer patients.

In this study, we used baseline olfactory identification measures with longitudinal flortaucipir and PiB PET, diffusion MRI of 89 cognitively normal older adults (73.82 ± 8.44 years; 56% females), and a transcriptomic data atlas to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading and genetic vulnerabilities of AD-related pathology aggregates in the olfactory system. We find that odor identification deficits are predominantly associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with a particularly strong predictive power for longitudinal tau progression. We observe that tau spreads from the medial temporal lobe structures toward the olfactory system, not the reverse. Moreover, we observed a genetic background of odor perception-related genes that might confer vulnerability to tau accumulation along the olfactory system.","Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Aging|Alzheimer Disease|Brain|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Olfactory Pathways|Olfactory Perception|Positron-Emission Tomography|Smell|Temporal Lobe|tau Proteins","Diez, Ibai|Ortiz-Terán, Laura|Ng, Thomas S C|Albers, Mark W|Marshall, Gad|Orwig, William|Kim, Chan-Mi|Bueichekú, Elisenda|Montal, Victor|Olofsson, Jonas|Vannini, Patrizia|El Fahkri, Georges|Sperling, Reisa|Johnson, Keith|Jacobs, Heidi I L|Sepulcre, Jorge",Nature communications,2024,2024-06-06,Journal Article,DC019579,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Gummy TAH was ranked favorite TAH for tactile realism, while Frankenstein TAH had the most favorable audible/visual indicators, including an illuminated Jacob's Ladder. Beating TAH demonstrated superior pulsatile hemodynamic performance compared to Claw TAH (16mL vs 1.3mL stroke volume). Light Up TAH and Gummy TAH functioned only as passive compliance chambers. Cute TAH rapidly exsanguinated due to its porosity (-3.0 L/min flow). These TAHs demonstrated a wide range of anatomical accuracy, surgeon appeal, unique features, and hemodynamic performance.

This difficulty largely stems from the inherent need for spectrum separation, which typically requires sophisticated and expensive optical components. Here, we demonstrate a compact, lens-free, and cost-effective fluorescence sensing setup that incorporates machine learning for scalable multiplexed fluorescence detection. This method utilizes low-cost optical components and a pretrained machine learning (ML) model to enable multiplexed fluorescence sensing without optical adjustments. Its multiplexing capability can be easily scaled up through updates to the machine learning model without altering the hardware. We demonstrate its real-world application in a probe-based multiplexed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay designed to simultaneously detect three common respiratory viruses within a single reaction. The effectiveness of this approach highlights the system's potential for point-of-care applications that require cost-effective and scalable solutions.

Unlike depot formulations, slowly releasing drug at the injection site into the blood, DcNP allows multiple-drug-in-combination to collectively distribute from the injection site into the lymphatic system. Two distinct classes of long-acting injectables products are proposed based on pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Class I involves sustained release at the injection site. Class II involves a drug-carrier complex composed of lopinavir, ritonavir, and tenofovir uptake and retention in the lymphatic system before systemic access as a part of the PBPK model validation. For clinical development, Class II long-acting drug-combination products, we leverage data from 3 nonhuman primate studies consisting of nine PK datasets: Study 1, varying fixed-dose ratios; Study 2, short multiple dosing with kinetic tails; Study 3, long multiple dosing (chronic). PBPK validation criteria were established to validate each scenario for all drugs. The models passed validation in 8 of 9 cases, specifically to predict Study 1 and 2, including PK tails, with ritonavir and tenofovir, fully passing Study 3 as well. PBPK model for lopinavir in Study 3 did not pass the validation due to an observable time-varying and delayed drug accumulation, which likely was due to ritonavir's CYP3A inhibitory effect building up during multiple dosing that triggered a mechanism-based drug-drug interaction (DDI). Subsequently, the final model enables us to account for this DDI scenario.","Animals|Anti-HIV Agents|Delayed-Action Preparations|Drug Combinations|Drug Delivery Systems|HIV|Humans|Long-acting|Lopinavir|Male|Mechanism-based inhibition|Models, Biological|Nanoparticles|PBPK|Ritonavir|Tenofovir|Validation","Perazzolo, Simone|Shen, Danny D|Scott, Ariel M|Ho, Rodney J Y",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2024,2024-06-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL152401,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

39132820,,doi:10.1021/acsnano.4c09692,Acoustofluidic Virus Isolation via Bessel Beam Excitation Separation Technology.,"The isolation of viruses from complex biological samples is essential for creating sensitive bioassays that assess the efficacy and safety of viral therapeutics and vaccines, which have played a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, existing methods of viral isolation are time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the multiple processing steps required, resulting in low yields. Here, we introduce the rapid, efficient, and high-resolution acoustofluidic isolation of viruses from complex biological samples via Bessel beam excitation separation technology (BEST). BEST isolates viruses by utilizing the nondiffractive and self-healing properties of 2D, in-plane acoustic Bessel beams to continuously separate cell-free viruses from biofluids, with high throughput and high viral RNA yield. By tuning the acoustic parameters, the cutoff size of isolated viruses can be easily adjusted to perform dynamic, size-selective virus isolation while simultaneously trapping larger particles and separating smaller particles and contaminants from the sample, achieving high-precision isolation of the target virus. BEST was used to isolate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from human saliva samples and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus from cell culture media, demonstrating its potential use in both practical diagnostic applications and fundamental virology research. With high separation resolution, high yield, and high purity, BEST is a powerful tool for rapidly and efficiently isolating viruses. It has the potential to play an important role in the development of next-generation viral diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","Acoustics|Animals|Bessel beam|COVID-19|Humans|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Saliva|acoustic separation|nanoparticle|viruses","Xia, Jianping|Wang, Zeyu|Becker, Ryan|Li, Feng|Wei, Fang|Yang, Shujie|Rich, Joseph|Li, Ke|Rufo, Joseph|Qian, Jiao|Yang, Kaichun|Chen, Chuyi|Gu, Yuyang|Zhong, Ruoyu|Lee, Patty J|Wong, David T W|Lee, Luke P|Huang, Tony Jun",ACS nano,2024,2024-08-20,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Aptamers are generated by SELEX, which is a time-consuming procedure. In this study, using in silico and computational tools, we attempt to predict whether an aptamer can interact with a specific protein target. We present multiple data representations of protein and aptamer pairs and multiple machine-learning-based models to predict aptamer-protein interactions with a fair degree of selectivity. One of our models showed 96.5% accuracy and 97% precision, which are significantly better than those of the previously reported models. Additionally, we used molecular docking and SPR binding assays for two aptamers and the predicted targets as examples to exhibit the robustness of the APIPred algorithm.

Here, we integrate targeted and bulk RNA sequencing (N = 2238 samples) to track the viral, bacterial, and functional content over geospatially distinct areas within Miami Dade County, USA, from 2020-2022. We used targeted amplicon sequencing to track diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants across space and time, and we found a tight correspondence with positive PCR tests from University students and Miami-Dade hospital patients. Additionally, in bulk metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate that the bacterial content of different wastewater sampling locations serving small population sizes can be used to detect putative, host-derived microorganisms that themselves have known associations with human health and diet. We also detect multiple enteric pathogens (e.g., Norovirus) and characterize viral diversity across sites. Moreover, we observed an enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in hospital wastewater; antibiotic-specific ARGs correlated to total prescriptions of those same antibiotics (e.g Ampicillin, Gentamicin).

We sought to determine the origin of one such cryptic wastewater lineage by tracking and characterising its persistence and genomic evolution over time. We first detected a cryptic lineage, WI-CL-001, in municipal wastewater in Wisconsin, USA, in January, 2022. To determine the source of WI-CL-001, we systematically sampled wastewater from targeted sub-sewershed lines and maintenance holes using compositing autosamplers. Viral concentrations in wastewater samples over time were measured by RT digital PCR. In addition to using metagenomic 12s rRNA sequencing to determine the virus's host species, we also sequenced SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domains, and, where possible, whole viral genomes to identify and characterise the evolution of this lineage. We traced WI-CL-001 to its source at a single commercial building. There we detected the cryptic lineage at concentrations as high as 2·7 × 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies per L. The majority of 12s rRNA sequences detected in wastewater leaving the identified source building were human. Additionally, we generated over 100 viral receptor binding domain and whole-genome sequences from wastewater samples containing the cryptic lineage collected over the 13 consecutive months this virus was detectable (January, 2022, to January, 2023). These sequences contained a combination of fixed nucleotide substitutions characteristic of Pango lineage B.1.234, which circulated in humans in Wisconsin at low levels from October, 2020, to February, 2021. Despite this, mutations in the spike gene and elsewhere resembled those subsequently found in omicron variants. We propose that prolonged detection of WI-CL-001 in wastewater indicates persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from a single human initially infected by an ancestral B.1.234 virus. The accumulation of convergent omicron-like mutations in WI-CL-001's ancestral B.1.234 genome probably reflects persistent infection and extensive within-host evolution. People who shed cryptic lineages could be an important source of highly divergent viruses that sporadically emerge and spread.

The current approach for predicting the likelihood of response to ICB is a single proportional biomarker (PD-L1) expressed in immune and tumor cells (Combined Positive Score, CPS) without differentiation by cell type, potentially explaining its limited predictive value. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) have shown a stronger association with ICB response than PD-L1. However, their exact composition, size, and spatial biology in HNSCC remain understudied. A detailed understanding of TLS is required for future use as a clinically applicable predictive biomarker. Pre-ICB tumor tissue sections were obtained from 9 responders (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 11 non-responders (progressive disease) classified via RECISTv1.1. A custom multi-immunofluorescence (mIF) staining assay was designed, optimized, and applied to characterize tumor cells (pan-cytokeratin), T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19, CD20), myeloid cells (CD16, CD56, CD163), dendritic cells (LAMP3), fibroblasts (α Smooth Muscle Actin), proliferative status (Ki67) and immunoregulatory molecules (PD1). Spatial metrics were compared among groups. Serial tissue sections were scored for TLS in both H&E and mIF slides. A machine learning model was employed to measure the effect of these metrics on achieving a response to ICB (SD, PR, or CR). A higher density of B lymphocytes (CD20+) was found in responders compared to non-responders to ICB (p=0.022). A positive correlation was observed between mIF and pathologist identification of TLS (<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> <i>= 0.66, p-value= <0.0001</i>). TLS trended toward being more prevalent in responders to ICB (p=0.0906). The presence of TLS within 100 μm of the tumor was associated with improved overall (p=0.04) and progression-free survival (p=0.03). A multivariate machine learning model identified TLS density as a leading predictor of response to ICB with 80% accuracy. Immune cell densities and TLS spatial location within the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the immune response to HNSCC and may potentially outperform CPS as a predictor of ICB response.",,"Ruiz-Torres, Daniel A|Bryan, Michael E|Hirayama, Shun|Merkin, Ross D|Luciani, Evelyn|Roberts, Thomas|Patel, Manisha|Park, Jong C|Wirth, Lori J|Sadow, Peter M|Sade-Feldman, Moshe|Stott, Shannon L|Faden, Daniel L",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,2024-09-12,Journal Article|Preprint,TR003793,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA ""legs"" on the motor body and RNA ""footholds"" on a track. Herein, we address the well-documented trade-off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg-foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0 % GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150 nm/sec, three-fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0 % GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single-molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets.

Identifying infected patients early with the support of predictive models helps dialysis centers implement concerted procedures (e.g., temperature screenings, universal masking, isolation treatments) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate outbreaks. We collect data from multiple sources, including demographics, clinical, treatment, laboratory, vaccination, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 surveillance. Previous early prediction models, such as logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost, require sophisticated feature engineering and need improved prediction performance. We create deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict SARS-CoV-2 infections during incubation. Our study shows deep learning models with minimal feature engineering can identify those infected patients more accurately than previously built models. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consistently performed well, with an AUC exceeding 0.80, peaking at 0.91 in August 2021. The CNN model also demonstrated strong results with an AUC above 0.75. Both models outperformed previous best XGBoost models by over 0.10 in AUC. Prediction accuracy declined as the pandemic evolved, dropping to approximately 0.75 between September 2021 and January 2022. Maintaining a 20% false positive rate, our LSTM and CNN models identified 66% and 64% of positive cases among patients, significantly outperforming XGBoost models at 42%. We also identify key features for dialysis patients by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the input features. By closely monitoring these factors, dialysis patients can receive earlier diagnoses and care, leading to less severe outcomes. Our research highlights the effectiveness of deep neural networks in analyzing longitudinal data, especially in predicting COVID-19 infections during the crucial incubation period.

The chronic stress leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, and infiltration by immune cells. Roles of metals in these diseases, particularly PH are largely unknown. This review first discusses the pathophysiology of PH including vascular oxidative stress, inflammation, and remodeling in PH; mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic changes in PH; ion channel and its alterations in the pathogenesis of PH as well as PH-associated right ventricular (RV) remodeling and dysfunctions. This review then summarizes metal general features and essentiality for the cardiovascular system and effects of metals on systemic blood pressure. Lastly, this review explores non-essential and essential metals and potential roles of their dyshomeostasis in PH and RV dysfunction. Although it remains early to conclude the role of metals in the pathogenesis of PH, emerging direct and indirect evidence implicates the possible contributions of metal-mediated toxicities in the development of PH. Future research should focus on comprehensive clinical metallomics study in PH patients; mechanistic evaluations to elucidate roles of various metals in PH animal models; and novel therapy clinical trials targeting metals.

The smoothing parameters are objectively chosen by maximum likelihood. The model is updated using batch data accumulated at prespecified time intervals, which allows for better approximation of the underlying binomial density function.

We performed a retrospective study of children diagnosed with MIS-C admitted to a single quaternary children's hospital from May 2020 to April 2021. We created an MIS-C severity score using the following parameters: hospital admission status (e.g., floor vs intensive care unit), need for inotropic or vasoactive medications, and need for mechanical ventilation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to associate risk factors corresponding to the MIS-C severity score. The study included 152 children who were followed for 14 days post hospital admission. A stepwise forward selection process identified seven physiologic variables associated with ""severe"" MIS-C according to a logistic regression. Specifically, a combination of elevated creatinine (p = 0.013), international normalized ratio (p = 0.002), brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.001), white blood cell count (p = 0.009), ferritin (p = 0.041), respiratory rate (p = 0.047), and decreased albumin (p = 0.047) led to an excellent discrimination between mild versus severe MIS-C (AUC = 0.915). This study derived a physiologic profile associated with the stratification of MIS-C severity. Based on a cohort of 152 individuals diagnosed with MIS-C, this study derived a nomenclature that stratifies the severity of MIS-C.

We aimed to identify relationships between taxa colonizing the URT and LRT and explore their relationship with development during childhood. We employed V4 16S rDNA sequencing to profile nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates collected from 183 subjects between 20 weeks and 18 years of age. These samples were collected prior to elective procedures at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia over the course of 20 weeks in 2020, from otherwise healthy subjects enrolled in a study investigating potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. After extraction, sequencing, and quality control, we studied the remaining 124 nasopharyngeal swabs and 98 tracheal aspirates, including 85 subject-matched pairs of samples. V4 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the nasopharynx is colonized by few, highly-abundant taxa, while the tracheal aspirates feature a diverse assembly of microbes. While no taxa co-occur in the URT and LRT of the same subject, clusters of microbiomes in the URT correlate with clusters of microbiomes in the LRT. The clusters identified in the URT correlate with subject age across childhood development. The correlation between clusters of taxa across sites may suggest a mutual influence from either a third site, such as the oropharynx, or host-extrinsic, environmental features.

To date, in the United States more than 8,862 cases of MIS-C have been identified and 72 deaths have occurred. This syndrome typically affects children between the ages of 5-13; 57% are Hispanic/Latino/Black/non-Hispanic, 61% of patients are males and 100% have either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had direct contact with someone with COVID-19. Unfortunately, diagnosis of MIS-C is difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, intensive care admission, and prolonged hospitalization. There is no validated biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of MIS-C. In this study, we used Grating-coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) microarray technology to develop biomarker signatures in pediatric salvia and serum samples from patients with MIS-C in the United States and Colombia. GCFP measures antibody-antigen interactions at individual regions of interest (ROIs) on a gold-coated diffraction grating sensor chip in a sandwich immunoassay to generate a fluorescent signal based on analyte presence within a sample. Using a microarray printer, we designed a first-generation biosensor chip with the capability of capturing 33 different analytes from 80  <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>μ</mi> <mi>L</mi></mrow> </math> of sample (saliva or serum). Here, we show potential biomarker signatures in both saliva and serum samples in six patient cohorts. In saliva samples, we noted occasional analyte outliers on the chip within individual samples and were able to compare those samples to 16S RNA microbiome data. These comparisons indicate differences in relative abundance of oral pathogens within those patients. Microsphere Immunoassay (MIA) of immunoglobulin isotypes was also performed on serum samples and revealed MIS-C patients had several COVID antigen-specific immunoglobulins that were significantly higher than other cohorts, thus identifying potential new targets for the second-generation biosensor chip. MIA also identified additional biomarkers for our second-generation chip, verified biomarker signatures generated on the first-generation chip, and aided in second-generation chip optimization. Interestingly, MIS-C samples from the United States had a more diverse and robust signature than the Colombian samples, which was also illustrated in the MIA cytokine data. These observations identify new MIS-C biomarkers and biomarker signatures for each of the cohorts. Ultimately, these tools may represent a potential diagnostic tool for use in the rapid identification of MIS-C.",COVID-19|MIS-C|biomarkers|diagnostic|microarray,"Maltz-Matyschsyk, Michele|Melchiorre, Clare K|Herbst, Katherine W|Hogan, Alexander H|Dibble, Kristina|O'Sullivan, Brandon|Graf, Joerg|Jadhav, Aishwarya|Lawrence, David A|Lee, William T|Carson, Kyle J|Radolf, Justin D|Salazar, Juan C|Lynes, Michael A|",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2023,2023-01-01,Journal Article,HD105613,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Children presenting with MIS-C to participating hospitals in the United Kingdom and the European Union between April 2020 and April 2021 were prospectively recruited. Whole-blood RNA Sequencing was performed, contrasting the transcriptomes of children with MIS-C (n = 38) to those from children with KD (n = 136), definite bacterial (DB; n = 188) and viral infections (DV; n = 138). Genes significantly differentially expressed (SDE) between MIS-C and comparator groups were identified. Feature selection was used to identify genes that optimally distinguish MIS-C from other diseases, which were subsequently translated into RT-qPCR assays and evaluated in an independent validation set comprising MIS-C (n = 37), KD (n = 19), DB (n = 56), DV (n = 43), and COVID-19 (n = 39). In the discovery set, 5696 genes were SDE between MIS-C and combined comparator disease groups. Five genes were identified as potential MIS-C diagnostic biomarkers (HSPBAP1, VPS37C, TGFB1, MX2, and TRBV11-2), achieving an AUC of 96.8% (95% CI: 94.6%-98.9%) in the discovery set, and were translated into RT-qPCR assays. The RT-qPCR 5-gene signature achieved an AUC of 93.2% (95% CI: 88.3%-97.7%) in the independent validation set when distinguishing MIS-C from KD, DB, and DV. MIS-C can be distinguished from KD, DB, and DV groups using a 5-gene blood RNA expression signature. The small number of genes in the signature and good performance in both discovery and validation sets should enable the development of a diagnostic test for MIS-C.",COVID-19|COVID-19 Testing|Child|Hospitals|Humans|MIS-C|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|diagnostic signature|host diagnostics|host response|pediatric infectious diseases|rapid diagnostics|transcriptomics,"Jackson, Heather R|Miglietta, Luca|Habgood-Coote, Dominic|D'Souza, Giselle|Shah, Priyen|Nichols, Samuel|Vito, Ortensia|Powell, Oliver|Davidson, Maisey Salina|Shimizu, Chisato|Agyeman, Philipp K A|Beudeker, Coco R|Brengel-Pesce, Karen|Carrol, Enitan D|Carter, Michael J|De, Tisham|Eleftheriou, Irini|Emonts, Marieke|Epalza, Cristina|Georgiou, Pantelis|De Groot, Ronald|Fidler, Katy|Fink, Colin|van Keulen, Daniëlle|Kuijpers, Taco|Moll, Henriette|Papatheodorou, Irene|Paulus, Stephane|Pokorn, Marko|Pollard, Andrew J|Rivero-Calle, Irene|Rojo, Pablo|Secka, Fatou|Schlapbach, Luregn J|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Tsolia, Maria|Usuf, Effua|Van Der Flier, Michiel|Von Both, Ulrich|Vermont, Clementien|Yeung, Shunmay|Zavadska, Dace|Zenz, Werner|Coin, Lachlan J M|Cunnington, Aubrey|Burns, Jane C|Wright, Victoria|Martinon-Torres, Federico|Herberg, Jethro A|Rodriguez-Manzano, Jesus|Kaforou, Myrsini|Levin, Michael",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2023,2023-06-30,Journal Article,HD105590,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

However, there is an absence of quick, population-wide olfactory tests to screen for olfactory disorders. The purpose of this study was to provide a proof-of-concept that SCENTinel 1.1, a rapid, inexpensive, population-wide olfactory test, can discriminate between anosmia (total smell loss), hyposmia (reduced sense of smell), parosmia (distorted odor perception), and phantosmia (odor sensation without a source). Participants were mailed a SCENTinel 1.1 test, which measures odor detection, intensity, identification, and pleasantness, using one of 4 possible odors. Those who completed the test (N = 287) were divided into groups based on their self-reported olfactory function: quantitative olfactory disorder only (anosmia or hyposmia, N = 135), qualitative olfactory disorder only (parosmia and/or phantosmia; N = 86), and normosmia (normal sense of smell; N = 66). SCENTinel 1.1 accurately discriminates quantitative olfactory disorders, qualitative olfactory disorders, and normosmia groups. When olfactory disorders were assessed individually, SCENTinel 1.1 discriminates between hyposmia, parosmia, and anosmia. Participants with parosmia rated common odors less pleasant than those without parosmia. We provide proof-of-concept that SCENTinel 1.1, a rapid smell test, can discriminate quantitative and qualitative olfactory disorders, and is the only direct test to rapidly discriminate parosmia.",Anosmia|COVID-19|Humans|Olfaction Disorders|SARS-CoV-2|Smell|anosmia|hyposmia|parosmia|phantosmia|prediction|smell test,"Hunter, Stephanie R|Hannum, Mackenzie E|Pellegrino, Robert|O'Leary, Maureen A|Rawson, Nancy E|Reed, Danielle R|Dalton, Pamela H|Parma, Valentina",Chemical senses,2023,2023-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

The research evaluates the efficacy of environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air, surface swabs and wastewater to predict COVID-19 cases. Using a prospective experimental design, air, surface swabs, and wastewater samples were collected from a college dormitory housing roughly 500 students from March to May 2021 at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL. Students were randomly screened for COVID-19 during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 concentration in environmental samples was quantified using Volcano 2nd Generation-qPCR. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the associations between time-lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples and COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in air, surface swab and wastewater samples on 52 (63.4 %), 40 (50.0 %) and 57 (68.6 %) days, respectively. On 19 (24 %) of 78 days SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three sample types. COVID-19 cases were reported on 11 days during the study period and SARS-CoV-2 was also detected two days before the case diagnosis on all 11 (100 %), 9 (81.8 %) and 8 (72.7 %) days in air, surface swab and wastewater samples, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples was an indicator of the presence of local COVID-19 cases and a 3-day lead indicator for a potential outbreak at the dormitory building scale.

We compared risk of hospitalization, surgery, and serious infections in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic patients with IBD in a multicenter, electronic health record-based cohort of biologic-treated patients. We identified adult patients with IBD who were new users of biologic agents (tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α] antagonists, ustekinumab, vedolizumab) from 5 academic institutions in California between 2010 and 2017. We compared the risk of all-cause hospitalization, IBD-related surgery, and serious infections in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic patients using 1:4 propensity score matching and survival analysis. We compared 240 Hispanic patients (53% male; 45% with ulcerative colitis; 73% TNF-α antagonist-treated; 20% with prior biologic exposure) with 960 non-Hispanic patients (51% male; 44% with ulcerative colitis; 67% TNF-α antagonist-treated; 27% with prior biologic exposure). After propensity score matching, Hispanic patients were younger (37 ± 15 vs 40 ± 16 y; P = .02) and had a higher burden of comorbidities (Elixhauser index, >0; 37% vs 26%; P < .01), without any differences in patterns of medication use, burden of inflammation, and hospitalizations. Within 1 year of biologic initiation, Hispanic patients had higher rates of hospitalizations (31% vs 23%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.74) and IBD-related surgery (7.1% vs 4.6%; aHR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.07-3.72), with a trend toward higher risk of serious infections (8.8% vs 4.9%; aHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.99-3.05).

These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell-free nucleic acids (cf-NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all-in-one nanoscaffold-based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D-PHP) self-therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D-PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial-templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli-responsive drug release, disc-mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme-like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf-NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long-term pain reduction. Therefore, self-therapeutic and epigenetic modulator-encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.",2D nanomaterials|3D hybrid protein nanoscaffolds|Animals|Humans|Inflammation|Intervertebral Disc|Intervertebral Disc Degeneration|Oxidative Stress|Porins|Porosity|Rats|Reactive Oxygen Species|epigenetic modification|inflammation|intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration|nanoscaffolds|oxidative stress|self-assembly,"Yang, Letao|Bhujel, Basanta|Hou, Yannan|Luo, Jeffrey|An, Seong Bae|Han, Inbo|Lee, Ki-Bum","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2023,2023-10-01,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in <i>X</i>/<i>Y</i> 2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10<sup>2</sup> copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need.

However, the impact of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Omicron, on the exhaled breath profile and diagnostic accuracy of breath analysis is unknown. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracies of breath analysis on detecting patients with COVID-19 when the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants were most prevalent. This diagnostic study included a cohort of patients who had positive and negative test results for COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between April 2021 and May 2022, which covers the period when the Delta variant was overtaken by Omicron as the major variant. Patients were enrolled through intensive care units and the emergency department at the University of Michigan Health System. Patient breath was analyzed with portable gas chromatography. Different sets of VOC biomarkers were identified that distinguished between COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants) and non-COVID-19 illness. Overall, 205 breath samples from 167 adult patients were analyzed. A total of 77 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [16.1] years; 41 [53.2%] male patients; 13 [16.9%] Black and 59 [76.6%] White patients) had COVID-19, and 91 patients (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [17.1] years; 43 [47.3%] male patients; 11 [12.1%] Black and 76 [83.5%] White patients) had non-COVID-19 illness. Several patients were analyzed over multiple days. Among 94 positive samples, 41 samples were from patients in 2021 infected with the Delta or other variants, and 53 samples were from patients in 2022 infected with the Omicron variant, based on the State of Michigan and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data. Four VOC biomarkers were found to distinguish between COVID-19 (Delta and other 2021 variants) and non-COVID-19 illness with an accuracy of 94.7%. However, accuracy dropped substantially to 82.1% when these biomarkers were applied to the Omicron variant. Four new VOC biomarkers were found to distinguish the Omicron variant and non-COVID-19 illness (accuracy, 90.9%). Breath analysis distinguished Omicron from the earlier variants with an accuracy of 91.5% and COVID-19 (all SARS-CoV-2 variants) vs non-COVID-19 illness with 90.2% accuracy. The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that breath analysis has promise for COVID-19 detection.

Administrative databases offer an opportunity to conduct generalizable research; however, identifying patients with MIS-C is challenging. We developed and validated algorithms to identify MIS-C hospitalizations in administrative databases. We developed 10 approaches using diagnostic codes and medication billing data and applied them to the Pediatric Health Information System from January 2020 to August 2021. We reviewed medical records at 7 geographically diverse hospitals to compare potential cases of MIS-C identified by algorithms to each participating hospital's list of patients with MIS-C (used for public health reporting). The sites had 245 hospitalizations for MIS-C in 2020 and 358 additional MIS-C hospitalizations through August 2021.

This variety of manifestations poses significant challenges in the development of treatment strategies. The increasing availability of precise phenotypic and multiomics data of cardiovascular disease patient populations has spurred the development of a variety of computational disease subtyping techniques to identify distinct subgroups with unique underlying pathogeneses. In this review, we outline the essential components of computational approaches to select, integrate, and cluster omics and clinical data in the context of cardiovascular disease research. We delve into the challenges faced during different stages of the analysis, including feature selection and extraction, data integration, and clustering algorithms. Next, we highlight representative applications of subtyping pipelines in heart failure and coronary artery disease. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future directions in the development of robust subtyping approaches that can be implemented in clinical workflows, ultimately contributing to the ongoing evolution of precision medicine in health care.",Algorithms|Biomarkers|Cardiovascular Diseases|Humans|Multiomics|Phenomics|Phenotype|Precision Medicine|algorithms|coronary artery disease|heart failure|multiomics|precision medicine,"Maiorino, Enrico|Loscalzo, Joseph","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2023,2023-07-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We studied rates of outpatient visits, new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) initiations, intra-articular glucocorticoid injections (iaGC), dispensed oral glucocorticoids and opioids, DMARD adherence, and DMARD discontinuation by quarter in March 2018-February 2021 (Q1 started in March). Incident rate ratios (IRR, pandemic vs prepandemic) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Poisson or Quasi-Poisson models stratified by diagnosis recency (incident JIA, <12 months ago; prevalent JIA, ≥12 months ago). Among 1294 children diagnosed with JIA, total and in-person outpatient visits for JIA declined during the pandemic (IRR, 0.88-0.90), most markedly in Q1 2020. Telemedicine visits, while higher during the pandemic, declined from 21% (Q1) to 13% (Q4) in 2020 to 2021. During the pandemic, children with prevalent JIA, but not incident JIA, had lower usage of iaGC (IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-1.07), oral glucocorticoids (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67), and opioids (IRR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.75). Adherence to and discontinuation of DMARDs was similar before and during the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, visits for JIA dropped by 10% to 12% in commercially insured children in the United States, declines partly mitigated by use of telemedicine. Pandemic-related declines in intra-articular glucocorticoids, oral glucocorticoids, and opioids were observed for children with prevalent, but not incident, JIA. These changes may have important implications for disease control and quality of life.","Antirheumatic Agents|Arthritis, Juvenile|COVID-19|Child|Glucocorticoids|Humans|Insurance|Pandemics|Quality of Life|Retrospective Studies","Horton, Daniel B|Yang, Yiling|Neikirk, Amanda|Huang, Cecilia|Crystal, Stephen|Davidow, Amy|Haynes, Kevin|Gerhard, Tobias|Rose, Carlos D|Strom, Brian L|Parlett, Lauren",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,2023,2023-12-01,Journal Article,HD105619,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

One of the complexities of this problem lies on the rapid prototyping of new devices and wireless rapid detection of small particles and virus alike. By reducing the complexity of microfluidics microfabrication and using economic materials along with makerspace tools (Kundu et al. 2018) it is possible to provide an affordable solution to both the problems of high-throughput devices and detection technologies. We present the development of a wireless, standalone device and disposable microfluidics chips that rapidly generate parallel readouts for selected, possible virus variants from a nasal or saliva sample, based on motorized and non-motorized microbeads detection, and imaging processing of the motion tracks of these beads in micrometers. Microbeads and SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 Delta variant were tested as proof-of-concept for testing the microfluidic cartridges and wireless imaging module. The Microbead Assay (MA) system kit consists of a Wi-Fi readout module, a microfluidic chip, and a sample collection/processing sub-system.

To better understand viral dynamics in BEs, this study assesses viromes from 11 habitats across four types of BEs with low to high occupancy. The diversity, composition, metabolic functions, and lifestyles of the viromes are found to be habitat dependent. Caudoviricetes species are ubiquitous on surface habitats in the BEs, and some of them are distinct from those present in other environments. Antimicrobial resistance genes are identified in viruses inhabiting surfaces frequently touched by occupants and in viruses inhabiting occupants' skin. Diverse CRISPR/Cas immunity systems and anti-CRISPR proteins are found in bacterial hosts and viruses, respectively, consistent with the strongly coupled virus-host links. Evidence of viruses potentially aiding host adaptation in a specific-habitat manner is identified through a unique gene insertion.

Despite the identification of a large number of associated genes and genetic loci, the precise mechanisms by which these genes systematically influence the phenotypic heterogeneity of CVD are not well understood. In addition to DNA sequence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CVD requires data from other omics levels, including the epigenome, the transcriptome, the proteome, as well as the metabolome. Recent advances in multiomics technologies have opened new precision medicine opportunities beyond genomics that can guide precise diagnosis and personalized treatment. At the same time, network medicine has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that integrates systems biology and network science to focus on the interactions among biological components in health and disease, providing an unbiased framework through which to integrate systematically these multiomics data. In this review, we briefly present such multiomics technologies, including bulk omics and single-cell omics technologies, and discuss how they can contribute to precision medicine.

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.",,"Hunter, Stephanie R|Beatty, Candelaria|Dalton, Pamela H",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,2023-06-05,Journal Article|Preprint,DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

A wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) program was established at the University of Miami (UM) in 2020, which included measurements of SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater from its hospital and within the regional WWTP. In addition to the development of a SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, qPCR assays to detect other human pathogens of interest were also developed at UM. Here we report on the use of a modified set of reagents published by the CDC to detect nucleic acids of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) which emerged during May of 2022 to become a concern worldwide. Samples collected from the University hospital and from the regional WWTP were processed through DNA and RNA workflows and analyzed by qPCR to detect a segment of the MPXV CrmB gene. Results show positive detections of MPXV nucleic acids in the hospital and wastewater treatment plant wastewater which coincided with clinical cases in the community and mirrored the overall trend of nationwide MPXV cases reported to the CDC. We recommend the expansion of current WBS programs' methods to detect a broader range of pathogens of concern in wastewater and present evidence that viral RNA in human cells infected by a DNA virus can be detected in wastewater.","COVID-19|DNA|Hospitals, University|Humans|MPXV|Monkeypox virus|Mpox|Mpox, Monkeypox|Nucleic Acids|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based surveillance|Wastewater|Workflow","Sharkey, Mark E|Babler, Kristina M|Shukla, Bhavarth S|Abelson, Samantha M|Alsuliman, Bader|Amirali, Ayaaz|Comerford, Samuel|Grills, George S|Kumar, Naresh|Laine, Jennifer|Lee, Jisue|Lamar, Walter E|Mason, Christopher E|Penso, Johnathon|Reding, Brian D|Schürer, Stephan C|Stevenson, Mario|Vidović, Dušica|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M",The Science of the total environment,2023,2023-09-10,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Materials and methods: We recruited cohorts from three sites: Federal Way, WA; Springdale, AR; and remotely. Participants received a survey that included demographic characteristics and questions regarding COVID-19. Participants completed symptom checks via text message every month and recorded their temperature daily using a Kinsa smart thermometer. Results: Recruitment and data collection is ongoing. Presently, 441 adults have consented to participate. One-third of participants were classified as essential workers during the pandemic. Discussion: Over the past 18 months, we have improved our strategies to elicit better data from participants and have learned from some of the weaknesses in our initial deployment of this type of surveillance system. Other limitations stem from historic inequities and barriers which limited Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island representation in academic and clinical environments. One manifestation of this was the limited ability to provide study materials and support in multiple languages. We hope that continued partnership with the community will allow further opportunities to help restore trust in academic and medical institutions, thus generating knowledge to advance health equity.

Institutions rapidly assembled task forces to develop treatment algorithms. At the national/international levels, collaboratives and associations assembled consensus writing groups to draft guidelines. These guidelines and algorithms were initially on the basis of expert opinion and small case series. Some groups used the Delphi approach, and the resultant guidelines often mimicked those for other conditions that resembled MIS-C, like Kawasaki disease (KD). For instance, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a known effective treatment for KD, was recommended for MIS-C. Early in the pandemic many favoured IVIG over steroids as first-line therapy. As evidence evolved so did some guidelines, which now endorse the dual use of IVIG with steroids as first-line therapy. In contrast, withholding immunotherapy became an option for some MIS-C patients with mild symptoms. Herein, we review guidelines and discuss the evidence informing early recommendations, how this has evolved, the role and limitations of expert opinion and observational data, and the importance of leveraging existing research infrastructures, such as the intensive care unit collaborative (Overcoming COVID-19 surveillance registry), and the International Kawasaki Disease Registry. Finally, we discuss strategies to rapidly develop, deploy, and adapt clinical trials evaluating the treatment of such rare conditions in children, which might include alternatives to conventional clinical trial design.

However, implementation of wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is limited due to the need for expert staff, expensive equipment, and prolonged processing times. As WBE increases in scope (beyond SARS-CoV-2) and scale (beyond developed regions), there is a need to make WBE processes simpler, cheaper, and faster. We developed an automated workflow based on a simplified method termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP). Our automated workflow takes 40 min from raw wastewater to purified RNA, which is several times faster than conventional WBE methods. The total assay cost per sample/replicate is $6.50 which includes consumables and reagents for concentration, extraction, and RT-qPCR quantification. The assay complexity is reduced significantly, as extraction and concentration steps are integrated and automated. The high recovery efficiency of the automated assay (84.5 ± 25.4%) yielded an improved Limit of Detection (LoD<sub>Automated</sub>=40 copies/mL) compared to the manual process (LoD<sub>Manual</sub>=206 copies/mL), increasing analytical sensitivity. We validated the performance of the automated workflow by comparing it with the manual method using wastewater samples from several locations. The results from the two methods correlated strongly (r = 0.953), while the automated method was shown to be more precise. In 83% of the samples, the automated method showed lower variation between replicates, which is likely due to higher technical errors in the manual process e.g., pipetting.

Initially, citrate-coated AuNPs were assembled via a short cationic peptide (RRK) and characterized by experiments and simulations. The dissociation peptides were then used to reversibly dissociate the AuNP aggregates as a function of target protease detection, i.e., main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), a biomarker for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of this system in developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. This process is believed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which the neurovascular system interacts with the brain and how it can be targeted for therapeutic purposes, this area of research holds great promise for the future of neurology and medicine. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials. To overcome the challenges of neurovascular systems and the issues with animal models, we have developed a one-of-a-kind <i>in vitro</i> neurovascular unit-on-a-chip to accurately replicate the <i>in vivo</i> human neurovascular microenvironment. This neuroinflammation-on-a-chip platform has the potential to enhance the current methods of drug development and testing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. By replicating the human neurovascular unit in vitro, a more accurate representation of human physiology can be achieved compared to animal models. The ability to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines in situ and monitor physiological changes, such as barrier function, in real-time can provide an invaluable tool for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs. Moreover, using nano-sized graphene oxide for in situ detection of inflammatory responses is an innovative approach that can advance the field of neuroinflammation research. <i>Overall</i>, our developed neuroinflammation-on-a-chip system has the potential to provide a more efficient and effective method for developing drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",Graphene-based nanosensor|Microfluidics|Neuroinflammation|Neurovascular system|Neurovascular unit-on-a-chip|Organ-on-a-chip,"Choi, Jin-Ha|Choi, Hye Kyu|Lee, Ki-Bum",Advanced functional materials,2023,2023-11-09,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
37428010,PMC10332812,doi:10.7554/eLife.82597,MYC overrides HIF-1α to regulate proliferating primary cell metabolism in hypoxia.,"Hypoxia requires metabolic adaptations to sustain energetically demanding cellular activities. While the metabolic consequences of hypoxia have been studied extensively in cancer cell models, comparatively little is known about how primary cell metabolism responds to hypoxia. Thus, we developed metabolic flux models for human lung fibroblast and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferating in hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we found that hypoxia decreased glycolysis despite activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and increased glycolytic enzyme expression. While HIF-1α activation in normoxia by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition did increase glycolysis, hypoxia blocked this effect. Multi-omic profiling revealed distinct molecular responses to hypoxia and PHD inhibition, and suggested a critical role for MYC in modulating HIF-1α responses to hypoxia. Consistent with this hypothesis, MYC knockdown in hypoxia increased glycolysis and MYC over-expression in normoxia decreased glycolysis stimulated by PHD inhibition. These data suggest that MYC signaling in hypoxia uncouples an increase in HIF-dependent glycolytic gene transcription from glycolytic flux.","Cell Hypoxia|Humans|Hypoxia|Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit|Lung|MYC|Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc|Signal Transduction|biochemistry|cell biology|chemical biology|human|hypoxia|hypoxia-inducible factor|metabolic flux analysis|prolyl hydroxylase","Copeland, Courtney A|Olenchock, Benjamin A|Ziehr, David|McGarrity, Sarah|Leahy, Kevin|Young, Jamey D|Loscalzo, Joseph|Oldham, William M",eLife,2023,2023-07-10,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Reduced CC16 protein concentrations in BAL and serum are associated with asthma susceptibility. <b>Objectives:</b> Few studies have investigated the relationship between CC16 and asthma progression, and none has focused on BECs. In this study, we sought to determine if CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs are associated with asthma severity. <b>Methods:</b> Association analyses between CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs (242 asthmatics and 69 control subjects) and asthma-related phenotypes in Severe Asthma Research Program were performed using a generalized linear model. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Low CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs were significantly associated with asthma susceptibility and asthma severity, high systemic corticosteroids use, high retrospective and prospective asthma exacerbations, and low pulmonary function. Low CC16 mRNA expression levels were significantly associated with high T2 inflammation biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide and sputum eosinophils). CC16 mRNA expression levels were negatively correlated with expression levels of Th2 genes (<i>IL1RL1</i>, <i>POSTN</i>, <i>SERPINB2</i>, <i>CLCA1</i>, <i>NOS2</i>, and <i>MUC5AC</i>) and positively correlated with expression levels of Th1 and inflammation genes (<i>IL12A</i> and <i>MUC5B</i>). A combination of two nontraditional T2 biomarkers (CC16 and IL-6) revealed four asthma endotypes with different characteristics of T2 inflammation, obesity, and asthma severity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings indicate that low CC16 mRNA expression levels in BECs are associated with asthma susceptibility, severity, and exacerbations, partially through immunomodulation of T2 inflammation. CC16 is a potential nontraditional T2 biomarker for asthma development and progression.","Asthma|Biomarkers|CC16|Epithelial Cells|Humans|Inflammation|Prospective Studies|RNA, Messenger|Retrospective Studies|T2 inflammation|Uteroglobin|asthma exacerbations|asthma severity|bronchial epithelial cells","Li, Xingnan|Guerra, Stefano|Ledford, Julie G|Kraft, Monica|Li, Huashi|Hastie, Annette T|Castro, Mario|Denlinger, Loren C|Erzurum, Serpil C|Fahy, John V|Gaston, Benjamin|Israel, Elliot|Jarjour, Nizar N|Levy, Bruce D|Mauger, David T|Moore, Wendy C|Zein, Joe|Kaminski, Naftali|Wenzel, Sally E|Woodruff, Prescott G|Meyers, Deborah A|Bleecker, Eugene R",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2023,2023-02-15,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

A common pitfall when utilizing AuNPs is their tendency to aggregate, especially when their surface is functionalized with ligands of low molecular weight (no steric repulsion) or ligands of neutral charge (no electrostatic repulsion). For biomedical applications, AuNPs that are colloidally stable are desirable because they have a high surface area and thus reactivity, resist sedimentation, and exhibit uniform optical properties. Here, we engineer the surface of AuNPs so that they remain stable when decorated with coiled-coil (CC) peptides while preserving the native polypeptide properties. We achieve this by using a neutral, mixed ligand layer composed of lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) and lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) maleimide to attach the CCs. Tuning the surface fraction of each component within the mixed ligand layer also allowed us to control the degree of AuNP labeling with CCs. We demonstrate the dynamic surface properties of these CC-AuNPs by performing a place-exchange reaction and their utility by designing an energy-transfer-based caspase-3 sensor.

This study aimed to showcase how wastewater monitoring, once established and accepted by a community, could readily be adapted to respond to newly emerging public health priorities. In this population-based study in Greater Tempe, Arizona, an existing opioid monitoring WBE network was modified to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the analysis of 11 contiguous wastewater catchments. Flow-weighted and time-weighted 24 h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected at each sampling location within the wastewater collection system for 3 days each week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021 (Area 7 and Tempe St Luke's Hospital were added in July, 2020). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the wastewater samples was used to determine the number of genome copies in each catchment. Newly detected clinical cases of COVID-19 by zip code within the City of Tempe, Arizona were reported daily by the Arizona Department of Health Services from May 23, 2020. Maricopa County-level new positive cases, COVID-19-related hospitalisations, deaths, and long-term care facility deaths per day are publicly available and were collected from the Maricopa County Epidemic Curve Dashboard. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 (genome copies per day) measured in wastewater from each catchment were aggregated at the zip code level and city level and compared with the clinically reported data using root mean square error to investigate early warning capability of WBE. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 1556 wastewater samples were analysed. Most locations showed two waves in viral levels peaking in June, 2020, and December, 2020-January, 2021. An additional wave of viral load was seen in catchments close to Arizona State University (Areas 6 and 7) at the beginning of the fall (autumn) semester in late August, 2020. Additionally, an early infection hotspot was detected in the Town of Guadalupe, Arizona, starting the week of May 4, 2020, that was successfully mitigated through targeted interventions. A shift in early warning potential of WBE was seen, from a leading (mean of 8·5 days [SD 2·1], June, 2020) to a lagging (-2·0 days [1·4], January, 2021) indicator compared with newly reported clinical cases. Lessons learned from leveraging an existing neighbourhood-level WBE reporting dashboard include: (1) community buy-in is key, (2) public data sharing is effective, and (3) sub-ZIP-code (postal code) data can help to pinpoint populations at risk, track intervention success in real time, and reveal the effect of local clinical testing capacity on WBE's early warning capability. This successful demonstration of transitioning WBE efforts from opioids to COVID-19 encourages an expansion of WBE to tackle newly emerging and re-emerging threats (eg, mpox and polio).

We hypothesise that a liberal oxygenation strategy during cardiac surgery leads to a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications than a restrictive oxygenation strategy. This study is a prospective, observer-blinded, centrally randomised and controlled, international multicentre clinical trial. After obtaining a written informed consent, 200 adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting will be enrolled and randomised to receive either restrictive or liberal oxygenation perioperatively. The liberal oxygenation group will receive 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen throughout the intraoperative period, including during cardiopulmonary bypass. The restrictive oxygenation group will receive the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain arterial partial pressure of oxygen between 100 and 150 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass and a pulse oximetry reading of 95% or greater intraoperatively, but no less than 0.3 and not higher than 0.80 (other than induction and when the oxygenation goals cannot be reached). When patients are transferred to the intensive care unit, all patients will receive an initial fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5, and then fraction of inspired oxygen will be titrated to maintain a pulse oximetry reading of 95% or greater until extubation. The lowest postoperative arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen within 48 hours of intensive care unit admission will be the primary outcome. Postoperative pulmonary complications, length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and 7-day mortality after cardiac surgery will be analysed as secondary outcomes.

Herein, the detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals was explored using noninvasive sampling and low-preparatory-work analytical instrumentation. Hand odor samples were obtained from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative individuals. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted from the collected hand odor samples using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was used to develop predictive models using the suspected variant sample subsets. The developed sPLS-DA models performed moderately (75.8% (±0.4) accuracy, 81.8% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity) at distinguishing between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative -individuals based on the VOC signatures alone.

Although studies have found that central venous catheter (CVC) is often associated with poor outcomes and switching to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) is beneficial, it has not been fully elucidated how the effect of switching of access on outcomes changes over time and whether the effect depends on switching time. In this paper we propose to relate the observed survival time for patients without access change and the counterfactual time for patients with access change using an AFT model with time-varying effects. The flexibility of AFT model allows us to account for baseline effect and the prognostic effect from covariates at access change while estimating the effect of access change. The effect of access change overtime is modeled nonparametrically using a cubic spline function. Simulation studies show excellent performance.

We performed RNA-seq on cultured ECs incubated with pre-treatment sera from KD (<i>n</i> = 5), MIS-C (<i>n</i> = 7), and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 3). We conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using 935 transcripts differentially expressed between MIS-C and KD using relaxed filtering (unadjusted <i>p</i> < 0.05, >1.1-fold difference). We found seven gene modules in MIS-C, annotated as an increased TNFα/NFκB pathway, decreased EC homeostasis, anti-inflammation and immune response, translation, and glucocorticoid responsive genes and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). To further understand the difference in the EC response between MIS-C and KD, stringent filtering was applied to identify 41 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MIS-C and KD (adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.05, >2-fold-difference). Again, in MIS-C, NFκB pathway genes, including nine pro-survival genes, were upregulated.

Pathogen surveillance systems faced pressure to quickly establish response protocols, offering an opportunity to employ wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for population-level monitoring. The pilot study reported herein aimed to: (i) develop a reliable protocol for MPXV DNA detection in wastewater which would reduce false negative reporting, (ii) test this protocol on wastewater from various regions across the United States, and (iii) conduct a state of the science review of the current literature reporting on experimental methods for MPXV detection using WBE. Twenty-four-hour composite samples of untreated municipal wastewater were collected from the states of New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, and Washington beginning July 3rd, 2022 through October 16th, 2022 (n = 60). Samples underwent vacuum filtration, DNA extraction from captured solids, MPXV DNA pre-amplification, and qPCR analysis. Of the 60 samples analyzed, a total of eight (13%) tested positive for MPXV in the states of Washington, Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois. The presence of clade IIb MPXV DNA in these samples was confirmed via Sanger sequencing and integration of pre-amplification prior to qPCR decreased the rate of false negative detections by 87% as compared to qPCR analysis alone. Wastewater-derived detections of MPXV were compared to clinical datasets, with 50% of detections occurring as clinical cases were increasing/peaking and 50% occurring as clinical cases waned. Results from the literature review (n = 9 studies) revealed successful strategies for the detection of MPXV DNA in wastewater, however also emphasized a need for further method optimization and standardization. Overall, this work highlights the use of pre-amplification prior to qPCR detection as a means to capture the presence of MPXV DNA in community wastewater and offers guidance for monitoring low-titer pathogens via WBE.",Emerging pathogens|Environmental Monitoring|Monkeypox virus|Pilot Projects|Public health|United States|Wastewater|Wastewater solids|Wastewater surveillance|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring|Wastewater-based epidemiology,"Bowes, Devin A|Henke, Katherine B|Driver, Erin M|Newell, Melanie Engstrom|Block, Izabella|Shaffer, Gray|Varsani, Arvind|Scotch, Matthew|Halden, Rolf U",The Science of the total environment,2023,2023-12-10,Journal Article,LM013129,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.",Fairness|adversarial training|biases|health disparities|machine learning,"Li, Bin|Shi, Xinghua|Gao, Hongchang|Jiang, Xiaoqian|Zhang, Kai|Harmanci, Arif O|Malin, Bradley",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,2023-08-26,Journal Article|Preprint,LM013755,,,,,,U24,False,RADx-rad,Data Coordinating Center

Large epidemiologic studies comparing MIS-C to Kawasaki disease (KD) and evaluating the evolving epidemiology of MIS-C over time are lacking. We sought to understand the illness severity of MIS-C compared with KD and evaluate changes in MIS-C illness severity over time during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic compared with KD. We included hospitalizations of children with MIS-C and KD from April 2020 to May 2022 from the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database. Our primary outcome measure was the presence of shock, defined as the use of vasoactive/inotropic cardiac support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We examined the volume of MIS-C and KD hospitalizations and the proportion of hospitalizations with shock over time using 2-week intervals. We compared the proportion of hospitalizations with shock in MIS-C and KD patients over time using generalized estimating equations adjusting for hospital clustering and age, with time as a fixed effect. We identified 4868 hospitalizations for MIS-C and 2387 hospitalizations for KD. There was a higher proportion of hospitalizations with shock in MIS-C compared with KD (38.7% vs 5.1%). In our models with time as a fixed effect, we observed a significant decrease in the odds of shock over time in MIS-C patients (odds ratio 0.98, P < .001) but not in KD patients (odds ratio 1.00, P = .062).

Understanding the role of autoantibodies in these conditions is essential for guiding MIS-C management and vaccination strategies in children. To investigate the presence of anticardiac autoantibodies in MIS-C or COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis. This diagnostic study included children with acute MIS-C or acute vaccine myocarditis, adults with myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy, healthy children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and healthy COVID-19 vaccinated adults. Participants were recruited into research studies in the US, United Kingdom, and Austria starting January 2021. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA anticardiac autoantibodies were identified with immunofluorescence staining of left ventricular myocardial tissue from 2 human donors treated with sera from patients and controls. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antihuman IgG, IgM, and IgA. Images were taken for detection of specific IgG, IgM, and IgA deposits and measurement of fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence intensity. Data were analyzed through March 10, 2023.

It is challenging to sample the lower airways non-invasively and the capability to identify a highly representative specimen that can be collected in a non-invasive way would provide opportunities to investigate metabolomic consequences of COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we performed a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution chromatography (LC-MS) on exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (COVID+) and negative controls, both non-hospitalized and hospitalized for other reasons (COVID-). We were able to noninvasively identify and quantify inflammatory oxylipin shifts and dysregulation that may ultimately be used to monitor COVID-19 disease progression or severity and response to therapy. We also expected EBC-based biochemical oxylipin changes associated with COVID-19 host response to infection. The results indicated ten targeted oxylipins showing significative differences between SAR-CoV-2 infected EBC samples and negative control subjects.

Moreover, all these compounds were up-regulated by COVID+, meaning their concentrations were higher in subjects with SAR-CoV-2 infection.

PO<sub>2</sub>tox is a mission limiting factor for special operations forces divers using closed-circuit rebreathing apparatus and a potential side effect for patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. In this study, we aim to determine if there is a specific breath profile of compounds in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) that is indicative of the early stages of pulmonary hyperoxic stress/PO<sub>2</sub>tox. Using a double-blind, randomized 'sham' controlled, cross-over design 14 U.S. Navy trained diver volunteers breathed two different gas mixtures at an ambient pressure of 2 ATA (33 fsw, 10 msw) for 6.5 h. One test gas consisted of 100% O<sub>2</sub>(HBO) and the other was a gas mixture containing 30.6% O<sub>2</sub>with the balance N<sub>2</sub>(Nitrox). The high O<sub>2</sub>stress dive (HBO) and low O<sub>2</sub>stress dive (Nitrox) were separated by at least seven days and were conducted dry and at rest inside a hyperbaric chamber. EBC samples were taken immediately before and after each dive and subsequently underwent a targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Following the HBO dive, 10 out of 14 subjects reported symptoms of the early stages of PO<sub>2</sub>tox and one subject terminated the dive early due to severe symptoms of PO<sub>2</sub>tox. No symptoms of PO<sub>2</sub>tox were reported following the nitrox dive. A partial least-squares discriminant analysis of the normalized (relative to pre-dive) untargeted data gave good classification abilities between the HBO and nitrox EBC with an AUC of 0.99 (±2%) and sensitivity and specificity of 0.93 (±10%) and 0.94 (±10%), respectively.

This strategy was based upon wastewater RNA measurements of the viral target, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The utility of WBS for assessing the spread of COVID-19 has motivated research to measure targets beyond SARS-CoV-2, including pathogens containing DNA. The objective of this study was to establish the necessary steps for isolating DNA from wastewater by modifying a long-standing RNA-specific extraction workflow optimized for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Modifications were made to the sample concentration process and included an evaluation of bead bashing prior to the extraction of either DNA or RNA. Results showed that bead bashing reduced detection of RNA from wastewater but improved recovery of DNA as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bead bashing is therefore not recommended for the quantification of RNA viruses using qPCR. Whereas for Mycobacterium bacterial DNA isolation, bead bashing was necessary for improving qPCR quantification. Overall, we recommend 2 separate workflows, one for RNA viruses that does not include bead bashing and one for other microbes that use bead bashing for DNA isolation. The experimentation done here shows that current-standing WBS program methodologies optimized for SARS-CoV-2 need to be modified and reoptimized to allow for alternative pathogens to be readily detected and monitored, expanding its utility as a tool for public health assessment.","COVID-19|Humans|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring|Workflow","Babler, Kristina M|Sharkey, Mark E|Amirali, Ayaaz|Boone, Melinda M|Comerford, Samuel|Currall, Benjamin B|Grills, George S|Laine, Jennifer|Mason, Christopher E|Reding, Brian|Schürer, Stephan|Stevenson, Mario|Vidović, Dušica|Williams, Sion L|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2023,2023-12-01,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

In this work, we report that VOCs emitted by walnuts can be studied using gas chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS), and those GC-DMS data can be analyzed to predict the rancidity of walnuts, i.e., classify walnuts into grades of freshness. Walnut kernels were assigned a class <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>n</mi></math> depending on their level of freshness as determined by a peroxide assay. VOC samples were analyzed using GC-DMS. From these VOC data, a partial least square regression (PLSR) model provided a freshness prediction value <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>m</mi></math>, which corresponded to the rancid class <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>n</mi></math> when <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>±</mo><mn>0.5</mn></mrow></math>.

We also conducted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) experiments to identify volatiles that emerged or were enhanced with more rancid walnuts. The findings of the GC-MS study of walnut VOCs align excellently with the GC-DMS study. Based on our results, we conclude that a GC-DMS device deployed with a pre-trained machine learning model can be a very effective device for classifying walnut grades in the industry.",differential mobility spectrometry|machine learning|mass spectrometry|peroxide value|rancidity,"Chakraborty, Pranay|Borras, Eva|Rajapakse, Maneeshin Y|McCartney, Mitchell M|Bustamante, Matthew|Mitcham, Elizabeth J|Davis, Cristina E",Applied food research,2023,2023-12-01,Journal Article,TR003795,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

We sought to identify functional genes for asthma by combining SNPs and mRNA expression in bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). Correlation analyses of mRNA expression of six candidate genes (<i>AP2A2</i>, <i>MUC6</i>, <i>MUC2</i>, <i>MUC5AC</i>, <i>MUC5B</i>, and <i>TOLLIP</i>) and asthma phenotypes were performed in the longitudinal cohort (<i>n</i> = 156) with RNAseq in BEC, and replicated in the cross-sectional cohort (<i>n</i> = 155). eQTL (<i>n</i> = 114) and genetic association analysis of asthma severity (426 severe vs. 531 non-severe asthma) were performed, and compared with previously published GWASs of IIPs and asthma. Higher expression of <i>AP2A2</i> and <i>MUC5AC</i> and lower expression of <i>MUC5B</i> in BEC were correlated with asthma, asthma exacerbations, and T2 biomarkers (<i>P</i> < 0.01). SNPs associated with asthma and IIPs in previous GWASs were eQTL SNPs for <i>MUC5AC</i>, <i>MUC5B</i>, or <i>TOLLIP</i>, however, they were not in strong linkage disequilibrium. The risk alleles for asthma or protective alleles for IIPs were associated with higher expression of <i>MUC5AC</i> and lower expression of <i>MUC5B</i>. rs11603634, rs12788104, and rs28415845 associated with moderate-to-severe asthma or adult onset asthma in previous GWASs were not associated with asthma severity (<i>P</i> > 0.8). SNPs associated with asthma in chr11p15.5 region are not associated with asthma severity neither with IIPs.

Carrying a designer nanoswitch, the DNA Net-aptamers release fluorescence signals upon virus binding that are easily read with a handheld fluorimeter for a rapid (in 10 min), simple (mix-and-read), sensitive (PCR equivalent), room temperature compatible, and inexpensive (∼$1.26/test) COVID-19 test assay. The DNA Net-aptamers also impede authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture with a near 1 × 10<sup>3</sup>-fold enhancement of the monomeric aptamer.

TMPRSS2 inhibition can reduce cancer invasion and metastasis and partially prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. Thus, there is an urgent need for both TMPRSS2-selective imaging and precise screening of TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Here, we report a TMPRSS2-responsive surface-potential-tunable peptide-conjugated probe (EGTP) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features for TMPRSS2 selective imaging and accurate inhibitor screening. The amphiphilic EGTP was constructed with tunable surface potential and responsive efficiency with TMPRSS2 and its inhibitor. The rational construction of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with modular peptides indicated that the cleavage of EGTP led to a gradual aggregation with bright fluorescence in high TMPRSS2-expressing cells.

We sought to determine phenotypic factors associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> throughout childhood in the Severe Asthma Research Program 3 pediatric cohort. Lung function was measured at baseline and annually. Multivariate linear mixed-effects models were constructed to assess the effect of baseline and time-varying predictors of prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> at each assessment for up to 6 years. All models were adjusted for age, predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> by Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations, race, sex, and height. Secondary outcomes included postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity. A total of 862 spirometry assessments were performed for 188 participants. Factors associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> include baseline Feno (B, -49 mL/log<sub>2</sub> PPB; 95% CI, -92 to -6), response to a characterizing dose of triamcinolone acetonide (B, -8.4 mL/1% change FEV<sub>1</sub> posttriamcinolone; 95% CI, -12.3 to -4.5), and maximal bronchodilator reversibility (B, -27 mL/1% change postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>; 95% CI, -37 to -16). Annually assessed time-varying factors of age, obesity, and exacerbation frequency predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> over time. Notably, there was a significant age and sex interaction.

Although many breath sample collection and analytical methods have been developed for breath analysis, analysis of metabolic VOCs in exhaled breath is still a challenge for clinical application. Many carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath are related to the metabolic processes of diseases. This work reports a method of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) for the analysis of a broad range of carbonyl metabolites in exhaled breath. Carbonyl compounds in the exhaled breath were captured by a fabricated silicon microreactor with a micropillar array coated with 2-(aminooxy)ethyl-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-trimethylammonium (ATM) triflate. A total of six subgroups consisting of saturated aldehydes and ketones, hydroxy-aldehydes, and hydroxy-ketones, unsaturated 2-alkenals, and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals were identified in the exhaled breath.

Therefore, to establish the predicted prevalence rate of taste loss in COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 376 papers published in 2020-2021, with 235 meeting all inclusion criteria. Drawing on previous studies and guided by early meta-analyses, we explored how methodological differences (direct vs. self-report measures) may affect these estimates. We hypothesized that direct measures of taste are at least as sensitive as those obtained by self-report and that the preponderance of evidence confirms taste loss is a symptom of COVID-19. The meta-analysis showed that, among 138,015 COVID-19-positive patients, 36.62% reported taste dysfunction (95% confidence interval: 33.02%-40.39%), and the prevalence estimates were slightly but not significantly higher from studies using direct (n = 15) versus self-report (n = 220) methodologies (Q = 1.73, df = 1, P = 0.1889).

We aimed to use a data-driven approach to identify clinical subgroups. We analysed clinical data from patients with Kawasaki disease diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego, CA, USA) between Jan 1, 2002, and June 30, 2022. Patients were grouped by hierarchical clustering on principal components with k-means parcellation based on 14 variables, including age at onset, ten laboratory test results, day of illness at the first intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, and normalised echocardiographic measures of coronary artery diameters at diagnosis. We also analysed the seasonality and Kawasaki disease incidence from 2002 to 2019 by subgroup. To explore the biological underpinnings of identified subgroups, we did differential abundance analysis on proteomic data of 6481 proteins from 32 patients with Kawasaki disease and 24 healthy children, using linear regression models that controlled for age and sex. Among 1016 patients with complete data in the final analysis, four subgroups were identified with distinct clinical features: (1) hepatobiliary involvement with elevated alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and total bilirubin levels, lowest coronary artery aneurysm but highest intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates (n=157); (2) highest band neutrophil count and Kawasaki disease shock rate (n=231); (3) cervical lymphadenopathy with high markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, and platelet counts) and lowest age-adjusted haemoglobin Z scores (n=315); and (4) young age at onset with highest coronary artery aneurysm but lowest intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates (n=313). The subgroups had distinct seasonal and incidence trajectories. In addition, the subgroups shared 211 differential abundance proteins while many proteins were unique to a subgroup. Our data-driven analysis provides insight into the heterogeneity of Kawasaki disease, and supports the existence of distinct subgroups with important implications for clinical management and research design and interpretation.

To accomplish this, the inner surface is modified to present binding moieties for the desired analyte. While this approach has been successful in research settings, it is challenging to scale many surface modification strategies. Traditional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices can be effectively functionalized using silane-based methods; however, it requires high labor hours, cleanroom equipment, and hazardous chemicals. Manufacture of microfluidic devices using plastics, including cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), allows chips to be mass produced, but most functionalization methods used with PDMS are not compatible with plastic. Here we demonstrate how to deposit biotin onto the surface of a plastic microfluidic chips using aryl-diazonium.

Despite the remarkable experimental efforts undertaken to date to determine the structure of the human interactome, many PPIs remain unmapped. Computational approaches, especially network-based methods, can facilitate the identification of previously uncharacterized PPIs. Many such methods have been proposed. Yet, a systematic evaluation of existing network-based methods in predicting PPIs is still lacking. Here, we report community efforts initiated by the International Network Medicine Consortium to benchmark the ability of 26 representative network-based methods to predict PPIs across six different interactomes of four different organisms: A. thaliana, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens. Through extensive computational and experimental validations, we found that advanced similarity-based methods, which leverage the underlying network characteristics of PPIs, show superior performance over other general link prediction methods in the interactomes we considered.",Animals|Caenorhabditis elegans|Computational Biology|Humans|Protein Interaction Mapping|Protein Interaction Maps|Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Wang, Xu-Wen|Madeddu, Lorenzo|Spirohn, Kerstin|Martini, Leonardo|Fazzone, Adriano|Becchetti, Luca|Wytock, Thomas P|Kovács, István A|Balogh, Olivér M|Benczik, Bettina|Pétervári, Mátyás|Ágg, Bence|Ferdinandy, Péter|Vulliard, Loan|Menche, Jörg|Colonnese, Stefania|Petti, Manuela|Scarano, Gaetano|Cuomo, Francesca|Hao, Tong|Laval, Florent|Willems, Luc|Twizere, Jean-Claude|Vidal, Marc|Calderwood, Michael A|Petrillo, Enrico|Barabási, Albert-László|Silverman, Edwin K|Loscalzo, Joseph|Velardi, Paola|Liu, Yang-Yu",Nature communications,2023,2023-03-22,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The development and simultaneous application of WBT measured biomarkers for research activities and for the pursuit of public health goals, both areas with well-established ethical frameworks. Currently, WBT practitioners do not employ a standardized ethical review process, introducing the potential for adverse outcomes for WBT professionals and community members. To address this deficiency, an interdisciplinary workshop developed a framework for a structured ethical review of WBT. The workshop employed a consensus approach to create this framework as a set of 11 questions derived from primarily public health guidance. This study retrospectively applied these questions to SARS-CoV-2 monitoring programs covering the emergent phase of the pandemic (3/2020-2/2022 (<i>n</i> = 53)). Of note, 43% of answers highlight a lack of reported information to assess. Therefore, a systematic framework would at a minimum structure the communication of ethical considerations for applications of WBT. Consistent application of an ethical review will also assist in developing a practice of updating approaches and techniques to reflect the concerns held by both those practicing and those being monitored by WBT supported programs.",COVID-19|Ethical Review|Humans|Public Health|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-based epidemiology|building-scale|ethics|structured review|sub-sewershed,"Bowes, Devin A|Darling, Amanda|Driver, Erin M|Kaya, Devrim|Maal-Bared, Rasha|Lee, Lisa M|Goodman, Kenneth|Adhikari, Sangeet|Aggarwal, Srijan|Bivins, Aaron|Bohrerova, Zuzana|Cohen, Alasdair|Duvallet, Claire|Elnimeiry, Rasha A|Hutchison, Justin M|Kapoor, Vikram|Keenum, Ishi|Ling, Fangqiong|Sills, Deborah|Tiwari, Ananda|Vikesland, Peter|Ziels, Ryan|Mansfeldt, Cresten",Environmental science & technology,2023,2023-09-05,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

An objective method with high specificity and high sensitivity to identify current or imminent MIS-C in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable. The aim was to learn about an interpretable novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel providing such an objective classification. This retrospective study was conducted on four groups of pediatric patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX who consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 70 MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January and May 2021 infected predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 MIS-C patients seen between August and October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between October 2021 andJanuary 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 was used to train an L1-regularized logistic regression model which was tested using five-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the remaining naïve groups. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and F1-score were used to quantify the performance of the cytokine/chemokine assay-based classifier. Standard laboratory markers predict MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.86 ± 0.05 and an F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.07, while the cytokine/chemokine panel predicted MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.95 ± 0.02 and an F1 score of 0.91 ± 0.04, with only sixteen of the forty-five cytokines/chemokines sufficient to achieve this performance. Tested on Group 2 the cytokine/chemokine panel yielded AUROC = 0.98 and F1 = 0.93, on Group 3 it yielded AUROC = 0.89 and F1 = 0.89, and on Group 4 AUROC = 0.99 and F1 = 0.97. Adding standard laboratory markers to the cytokine/chemokine panel did not improve performance. A top-10 subset of these 16 cytokines achieves equivalent performance on the validation data sets. Our findings demonstrate that a sixteen-cytokine/chemokine panel as well as the top ten subset provides a highly sensitive, and specific method to identify MIS-C in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of all the major variants identified to date.",COVID-19|SARS CoV-2|cytokine|inflammation|machine learning,"Subramanian, Devika|Vittala, Aadith|Chen, Xinpu|Julien, Christopher|Acosta, Sebastian|Rusin, Craig|Allen, Carl|Rider, Nicholas|Starosolski, Zbigniew|Annapragada, Ananth|Devaraj, Sridevi",Journal of clinical medicine,2023,2023-08-22,Journal Article,HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Existing approaches to estimating the time origins are commonly built on extrapolating a parametric longitudinal model, which rely on rigid assumptions that can lead to biased inferences. In this paper, we introduce a flexible semiparametric curve registration model. It assumes the longitudinal trajectories follow a flexible common shape function with person-specific disease progression pattern characterized by a random curve registration function, which is further used to model the unknown time origin as a random start time. This random time is used as a link to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data where the unknown time origins are integrated out in the joint likelihood function, which facilitates unbiased and consistent estimation. Since the disease progression pattern naturally predicts time-to-event, we further propose a new functional survival model using the registration function as a predictor of the time-to-event. The asymptotic consistency and semiparametric efficiency of the proposed models are proved. Simulation studies and two real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.",accelerated failure time|curve registration|joint modeling|left censoring|sieve estimation,"Wang, Tianhao|Ratcliffe, Sarah J|Guo, Wensheng",Journal of the American Statistical Association,2023,2023-01-01,Journal Article,DK130067,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

Our novel microfabrication process and custom-built signal conditioning hardware provides the advantage of providing accurate features and steady signals. The fabrication process relies on standard microfabrication techniques (i.e., deposition, photolithography, and wet etching). This fabrication method involves the novel application of two layers of positive and negative photoresists in addition to Parafilm<sup>®</sup> wax tape. Open edge and tiered depth details were successfully created from a multilayer planar mask. This is a benefit for integrated miniaturized and microfluidic systems that often require micro features for their functionality but relatively large millimeter size features for their physical periphery. We demonstrate the fundamental performance of electrospray with this microfluidic chip. The emitter tip was fixed on a linear axis stage with high resolution (10 μm) to finely control the tip distance from a metal counter electrode plate. A custom printed circuit board system was built to safely control four voltages applied to the microchip ports from a single high voltage power supply. To readily form the electrospray, non-aqueous solvents were used for their low viscosity and a constant voltage of +2.7 kV was applied to the sheath electrospray microchannel. The liquid being sprayed was 80/20 (v/v) methanol/acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid in the sheath microchannel and with ammonium acetate (10-40 mM) in its remaining microchannels. The electrospray signal was measured in response to varying the distance (1.4 to 1.6 mm) between the electrospray emitter tip and a metal counter electrode plate in addition to the varying concentration of the background electrolyte, ammonium acetate. Stable and repeatable electrospray signal showed linear relationships with emitter tip distance and concentration (r<sup>2</sup>≥0.95).",electrospray ionization|electrospray stability|glass etching|glass microfabrication|microfluidics|miniaturization,"Schmidt, Alexander J|Zamuruyev, Konstantin O|LeVasseur, Michael K|Fung, Stephanie|Anishchenko, Ilya M|Kenyon, Nicholas J|Davis, Cristina E",Microelectronic engineering,2023,2023-05-01,Journal Article,TR003795,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 can shed the virus through the gastrointestinal tract, enabling the quantification of the virus in stool and ultimately in wastewater (WW). Unfortunately, instability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater limits the utility of WBE programs, particularly in remote/rural regions where reliable cold storage and/or rapid shipping may be unavailable. This study examined whether rapid SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction on the day of sample collection could minimize degradation. Importantly, the extraction technology used in these experiments, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), is lightweight, portable, and electricity-free, making it suitable for implementation in remote settings. We demonstrated that immediate RNA extraction followed by ambient storage significantly increased the RNA half-life compared to raw wastewater samples stored at both 4 °C or ambient temperature. Given that RNA degradation negatively impacts both the sensitivity and precision of WBE measurements, efforts must be made to mitigate degradation in order to maximize the potential impact of WBE on public health.","COVID-19|Degradation|Electricity|Humans|RNA stabilization|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Temperature|Wastewater","Torabi, Soroosh|Amirsoleimani, Atena|Dehghan Banadaki, Mohammad|Strike, William Dalton|Rockward, Alexus|Noble, Ann|Liversedge, Matthew|Keck, James W|Berry, Scott M",The Science of the total environment,2023,2023-06-20,Journal Article,DA053903,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

While regeneration within the central nervous system is minimal, peripheral nerves can regenerate, albeit with limitations. The regenerative mechanisms of the peripheral nervous system thus provide fertile ground for clinical and scientific advancement, and opportunities to learn fundamental lessons regarding nerve behavior in the context of regeneration, particularly the relationship of axons to their support cells and the extracellular matrix environment. However, few current interventions adequately address peripheral nerve injuries. This article aims to elucidate areas in which progress might be made toward developing better interventions, particularly using synthetic nerve grafts. The article first provides a thorough review of peripheral nerve anatomy, physiology, and the regenerative mechanisms that occur in response to injury. This is followed by a discussion of currently available interventions for peripheral nerve injuries. Promising biomaterial fabrication techniques which aim to recapitulate nerve architecture, along with approaches to enhancing these biomaterial scaffolds with growth factors and cellular components, are then described.

However, achieving biocompatibility and bioorthogonality with current synthetic methods remains a challenge. We report herein a novel surface functionalization method that proceeds chemoselectively and without a free transition metal catalyst. In this method, a coating is first formed via the tyrosinase-catalyzed putative polymerization of a tetrazine-containing catecholamine (DOPA-Tet). One or more types of molecule of interest containing <i>trans</i>-cyclooctene are then grafted onto the coating via tetrazine ligation. The entire process proceeds under physiological conditions and is suitable for grafting bioactive molecules with diverse functions and structural complexities. Utilizing this method, we functionalized material surfaces with enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase), a cyclic peptide (cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys], or c(RGDfK)), and an antibiotic (vancomycin). Colorimetric assays confirmed the maintenance of the biocatalytic activities of the grafted enzymes on the surface. We established the mammalian cytocompatibility of the functionalized materials with fibroblasts. Surface functionalization with c(RGDfK) showed improved fibroblast cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Microbiological studies with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> indicated that surfaces coated using DOPA-Tet inhibit the formation of biofilms.

We preprocessed 9166 COVID-19 Structured Query Language (SQL) code, summary statistics, and user activity logs, from the GitHub repository of the Reliable Response Data Discovery for COVID-19 (R2D2) Consortium. The repository collected local summary statistics from participating institutions and aggregated the global result to a COVID-19-related clinical query, previously posted by clinicians on a website. We developed both on-chain and off-chain components to store/query these activity logs and their associated queries/results on a blockchain for immutability, transparency, and high availability of research communication. We measured run-time efficiency of contract deployment, network transactions, and confirmed the accuracy of recorded logs compared to a centralized baseline solution. The smart contract deployment took 4.5 s on an average. The time to record an activity log on blockchain was slightly over 2 s, versus 5-9 s for baseline. For querying, each query took on an average less than 0.4 s on blockchain, versus around 2.1 s for baseline.

Up to 30% of patients develop coronary artery abnormalities, which are reduced with early treatment. Timely diagnosis of KD is challenging but may become more straightforward with the recent discovery of a whole-blood host response classifier that discriminates KD patients from patients with other febrile conditions. Here, we bridged this microarray-based classifier to a clinically applicable quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay: the Kawasaki Disease Gene Expression Profiling (KiDs-GEP) classifier. We designed and optimized a qRT-PCR assay and applied it to a subset of samples previously used for the classifier discovery to reweight the original classifier. The performance of the KiDs-GEP classifier was comparable to the original classifier with a cross-validated area under the ROC curve of 0.964 [95% CI: 0.924-1.00] vs 0.992 [95% CI: 0.978-1.00], respectively. Both classifiers demonstrated similar trends over various disease conditions, with the clearest distinction between individuals diagnosed with KD vs viral infections. We successfully bridged the microarray-based classifier into the KiDs-GEP classifier, a more rapid and more cost-efficient qRT-PCR assay, bringing a diagnostic test for KD closer to the hospital clinical laboratory. A diagnostic test is needed for Kawasaki disease and is currently not available. We describe the development of a One-Step multiplex qRT-PCR assay and the subsequent modification (i.e., bridging) of the microarray-based host response classifier previously described by Wright et al. The bridged KiDs-GEP classifier performs well in discriminating Kawasaki disease patients from febrile controls.

Although effective for most, a subset of patients with asthma experience CS-resistant disease despite receiving high-dose medication. We sought to investigate the transcriptomic response of bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) to inhaled CSs. Independent component analysis was performed on datasets, detailing the transcriptional response of BECs to CS treatment. The expression of these CS-response components was examined in 2 patient cohorts and investigated in relation to clinical parameters. Supervised learning was used to predict BEC CS responses using peripheral blood gene expression. We identified a signature of CS response that was closely correlated with CS use in patients with asthma. Participants could be separated on the basis of CS-response genes into groups with high and low signature expression. Patients with low expression of CS-response genes, particularly those with a severe asthma diagnosis, showed worse lung function and quality of life. These individuals demonstrated enrichment for T-lymphocyte infiltration in endobronchial brushings. Supervised machine learning identified a 7-gene signature from peripheral blood that reliably identified patients with poor CS-response expression in BECs. Loss of CS transcriptional responses within bronchial epithelium was related to impaired lung function and poor quality of life, particularly in patients with severe asthma.

However, detection and concentration of pathogens in the environmental samples and their efficacy in predicting infectious diseases can be influenced by meteorological conditions and quality of samples. This research examines whether meteorological conditions and sample pH affect SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater samples, and whether the association of SARS-CoV-2 with COVID-19 cases and mortality improves when adjusted for meteorological conditions and sample pH value in Miami-Dade County, FL. Daily wastewater samples were collected from Miami-Dade Wastewater Treatment Plant in Key Biscayne, Florida from August 2021 to August 2022. The samples were analyzed for pH and spiked with OC43. RNA was extracted from the concentrated wastewater sample and SARS-CoV-2 was quantified using qPCR. COVID-19 and mortality data were acquired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and meteorological data from the National Climatic Data Center. COVID-19 case and mortality rates were modelled with respect to time-lagged wastewater SARS-CoV-2 adjusting for meteorological conditions, and sample pH value and OC43 recovery. Temperature, dew point, pH values and OC43 recovery showed significant associations with wastewater SARS-CoV-2. Time-lagged wastewater SARS-CoV-2 showed significant associations with COVID-19 case and mortality incidence rates. This association improved when wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels were adjusted for (or instrumented on) meteorological conditions, OC43 recovery, and sample pH. A 0.47% change in COVID-19 case incidence rate was associated with 1% change in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 (β ~ 0.47; 95% CI = 0.29 - 0.64; p < 0.001). A 0.12 % change in COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with 1 % change in SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater 44 days prior. A 0.07% decline in COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with a unit increase in ambient temperature 28 days prior.

The refractive index is one of the crucial optical properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which is changeable via the variation of gas species and concentrations that can be utilized as gas detectors.

37578304,PMC10614164,doi:10.1039/d3an00873h,An approach to zwitterionic peptide design for colorimetric detection of the Southampton norovirus SV3CP protease.,"Noroviruses are highly contagious and are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Due to a lack of effective antiviral therapies, there is a need to diagnose and surveil norovirus infections to implement quarantine protocols and prevent large outbreaks. Currently, the gold standard of diagnosis uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but PCR can have limited availability. Here, we propose a combination of a tunable peptide substrate and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to colorimetrically detect the Southampton norovirus 3C-like protease (SV3CP), a key protease in viral replication. Careful design of the substrate employs a zwitterionic peptide with opposite charged moieties on the C- and N- termini to induce a rapid color change visible to the naked eye; thus, this color change is indicative of SV3CP activity. This work expands on existing zwitterionic peptide strategies for protease detection by systematically evaluating the effects of lysine and arginine on nanoparticle charge screening. We also determine a limit of detection for SV3CP of 28.0 nM with comparable results in external breath condensate, urine, and fecal matter for 100 nM of SV3CP. The key advantage of this system is its simplicity and accessibility, thus making it an attractive tool for qualitative point-of-care diagnostics.",Caliciviridae Infections|Colorimetry|Endopeptidases|Feces|Gold|Humans|Metal Nanoparticles|Norovirus|Peptide Hydrolases|Peptides|Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,"Yeung, Justin|Jin, Zhicheng|Ling, Chuxuan|Retout, Maurice|Barbosa da Silva, Elany|Damani, Manan|Chang, Yu-Ci|Yim, Wonjun|O'Donoghue, Anthony J|Jokerst, Jesse V",The Analyst,2023,2023-09-11,Journal Article,DE031114,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

We investigated poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles (NP), containing a peptide targeted to tissue factor (TF) for delivery of 17R-RvD1 and a synthetic analog 17-R/S-benzo-RvD1 (benzo-RvD1) using in vitro and in vivo models of acute vascular injury. NPs were characterized in vitro by size, drug loading, drug release, TF binding, and vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays. NPs were also characterized in a rat model of carotid angioplasty.

We analyzed 62 wk of data from 19 sites participating in the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network to characterize wastewater metrics around the Delta and Omicron surges. We found that wastewater data identified outbreaks 4 to 5 d before case data (reported on the earlier of the symptom start date or test collection date), on average. At most sites, correlations between wastewater and case data were similar regardless of how wastewater concentrations were normalized and whether calculated with county-level or sewershed-level cases, suggesting that officials may not need to geospatially align case data with sewershed boundaries to gain insights into disease transmission. Although wastewater trend lines captured clear differences in the Delta versus Omicron surge trajectories, no single wastewater metric (detectability, percent change, or flow-population normalized viral concentrations) reliably signaled when these surges started. After iteratively examining different combinations of these three metrics, we developed the Covid-SURGE (Signaling Unprecedented Rises in Groupwide Exposure) algorithm, which identifies unprecedented signals in the wastewater data. With a true positive rate of 82%, a false positive rate of 7%, and strong performance during both surges and in small and large sites, our algorithm provides public health officials with an automated way to flag community-level COVID-19 surges in real time.","Algorithms|Benchmarking|COVID-19|COVID-19 surge|Disease Outbreaks|Humans|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|alert algorithm|early warning|wastewater monitoring","Keshaviah, Aparna|Huff, Ian|Hu, Xindi C|Guidry, Virginia|Christensen, Ariel|Berkowitz, Steven|Reckling, Stacie|Noble, Rachel T|Clerkin, Thomas|Blackwood, Denene|McLellan, Sandra L|Roguet, Adélaïde|Musse, Isabel",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2023,2023-08-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053899,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater
,,doi:10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06434,Understanding Oligonucleotide Hybridization and the Role of Anchoring on the Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Corona Phase for Viral Sensing Applications,"Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored corona phases (CPs), or surface-adsorbed molecules, have emerged as a promising interface for sensing applications. The adsorption of an analyte can be specifically transduced as a modulation of their band-gap near-infrared (nIR) photoluminescence (PL). One such CP ideal for this purpose is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where subsequent sequence-dependent hybridization can result in PL emission wavelength shifts. Due to ssDNA adsorption to the SWCNT surface, the resultant noncanonical hybridization and its effect on SWCNT photophysical properties are not well understood. In this work, we study 20- and 21-mer DNA and RNA hybridization on the complementary ssDNA-SWCNT CP in the context of nucleic acid sensing for SARS-CoV-2 sequences as model analytes. We found that the van’t Hoff transition enthalpy of hybridization on SWCNT CP was −11.9 kJ mol–1, much lower than that of hybridization in solution (−707 kJ mol–1). We used SWCNT solvatochromism to calculate the solvent-exposed surface area to indicate successful hybridization. We found that having a 30-mer anchor region in addition to the complementary region significantly improved PL response sensitivity and selectivity, with a (GT)15 anchor preferred for RNA targets. Coincubation of ssDNA-SWCNTs with an analyte at 37 °C resulted in faster hybridization kinetics without sacrificing specificity. Other methods aimed to improve CP rearrangement kinetics such as bath sonication and surfactant additions were ineffective. We also determined that the target sequence choice is important as secondary structure formation in the target is negatively correlated with hybridization. Best-performing CPs showed detection limits of 11 and 13 nM for DNA and RNA targets, respectively. Finally, we simulated sensing conditions using the saliva environment, showing sensor compatibility in biofluids. In total, this work elucidates key design features and processing to enable sequence-specific hybridization on ssDNA-SWCNT CPs.",|Carbon nanotubes|Genetics|Hybridization|Quantum mechanics|Sensors,Cui J|Gong X|Cho S-Y|Jin X|Yang S|Khosravi-Far R|Strano MS,J Phys Chem C,2023,,Journal Article,DE030829,,,,,,R42,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
38516674,PMC10956508,doi:10.36922/ijb.0118,3D-printed hydrogels dressings with bioactive borate glass for continuous hydration and treatment of second-degree burns.,"Recent advances in additive manufacturing have led to the development of innovative solutions for tissue regeneration. Hydrogel materials have gained significant attention for burn wound treatment in clinical practice among various advanced dressings due to their soothing and moisturizing activity. However, prolonged healing, pain, and traumatic removal due to the lack of long-term wound hydration are some of the challenges in the treatment of second-degree burn wounds. In this study, 3D-printed dressings were fabricated using gelatin, alginate, and bioactive borate glass (BBG) using an extrusion-based bioprinter. After ionic crosslinking, the 3D-printed dressings were characterized for mechanical properties, degradation rate, hydration activity, and <i>in vitro</i> cell viability using human fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that in 3D-printed dressings with 20 wt% BBG, Young's modulus increased by 105%, and 10-day degradation rate decreased by 62%. Addition of BBG prevented the burst release of water from hydrogel dressings and enabled the continuous water release for up to 10 days, which is crucial in treating second-degree burn wounds. 3D-printed hydrogel dressings with BBG showed long-term cell viability that can be a result of the accumulative release of therapeutic ions from BBG particulate. The <i>in vivo</i> wound healing functionality of the dressings was investigated using a rat model with a second-degree burn wound. Our animal study showed that the 3D-printed dressings with BBG exhibited faster wound closure, non-adhesive contact, non-invasive debridement, and non-traumatic dressing removal. Histological analysis suggested that 3D-printed dressings contributed to more uniform re-epithelialization and tissue remodeling compared to the non-printed hydrogels of the same compositions. Critically, 3D-printed dressings with BBG led to significant regeneration of hair follicles compared to the 3D-printed hydrogel, non-printed hydrogel, and the control groups. The superior outcome of the 3D-printed hydrogel-BBG20 dressings can be attributed to the bioactive formulation, which promotes moist wound healing for longer time periods, and the non-adhesive porous texture of the 3D-printed dressings with increased wound-dressing interactions. Our findings provided proof of concept for the synergistic effect of bioactive formulation and the porous texture of the 3D-printed hydrogel dressings incorporated with BBG on continuous water release and, consequently, on second-degree burn wound healing.",3D printing|Bioactive borate glass|Burn wound healing|Continuous water release|Hydrogel wound dressing,"Fayyazbakhsh, Fateme|Khayat, Michael J|Sadler, Candy|Day, Delbert|Huang, Yue-Wern|Leu, Ming C",International journal of bioprinting,2023,2023-10-15,Journal Article,HL152410,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

WBE has been adopted as one of the methods to monitor the spread and population dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but significant challenges remain in the bioinformatic analysis of WBE-derived data. Here, we have developed a new distance metric, CoVdist, and an associated analysis tool that facilitates the application of ordination analysis to WBE data and the identification of viral population changes based on nucleotide variants. We applied these new approaches to a large-scale dataset from 18 cities in nine states of the USA using wastewater collected from July 2021 to June 2022. We found that the trends in the shift between the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 lineages were largely consistent with what was seen in clinical data, but that wastewater analysis offered the added benefit of revealing significant differences in viral population dynamics at the state, city, and even neighborhood scales. We also were able to observe the early spread of variants of concern and the presence of recombinant lineages during the transitions between variants, both of which are challenging to analyze based on clinically-derived viral genomes. The methods outlined here will be beneficial for future applications of WBE to monitor SARS-CoV-2, particularly as clinical monitoring becomes less prevalent.

Devices integrated with electrochemical biosensors may be an interesting alternative to respond to the high demand for testing, particularly in contexts where access to standard detection technologies is lacking. Aptamers as recognition elements are useful due to their stability, specificity, and sensitivity to binding target molecules. We have developed a non-invasive electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor targeting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva. The aptamer is expected to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and its variants. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes coated with platinum nanoparticles were biofunctionalized with a biotin-tagged aptamer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for BA.1 sensing was conducted in sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate solution supplemented with pooled saliva. To estimate sensing performance, the aptasensor was tested with contrived samples of UV-attenuated virions from 10 to 10,000 copies/ml. Selectivity was assessed by exposing the aptasensor to non-targeted viruses (hCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). EIS data outputs were further used to select a suitable response variable and cutoff frequency. Capacitance increases in response to the gradual loading of the attenuated BA.1. The aptasensor was sensitive and specific for BA.1 at a lower viral load (10-100 copies/ml) and was capable of discriminating between negative and positive contrived samples (with strain specificity against other viruses: OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). The aptasensor detected SARS-CoV-2 with an estimated LOD of 1790 copies/ml in contrived samples. In human clinical samples, the aptasensor presents an accuracy of 72%, with 75% of positive percent of agreement and 67% of negative percent of agreement. Our results show that the aptasensor is a promising candidate to detect SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection when virion concentrations are low, which may be useful for preventing the asymptomatic spread of CoVID-19.","COVID-19|Graphite|Humans|Influenza, Human|Lasers|Metal Nanoparticles|Oligonucleotides|Pandemics|Platinum|SARS-CoV-2|Saliva","Moreira, Geisianny|Qian, Hanyu|Datta, Shoumen Palit Austin|Bliznyuk, Nikolay|Carpenter, Jeremiah|Dean, Delphine|McLamore, Eric|Vanegas, Diana",PloS one,2023,2023-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",AA029328,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances on the inner walls of arteries. It can affect arteries of heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis and kidney, resulting in ischemic heart disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease. Laser-based treatment techniques like laser atherectomy can be used to treat many common atherosclerostic diseases. However, the use of laser-based treatment remains limited due to the high risk of complications and low efficiency in removing atherosclerostic plaques as compared with other treatment methods. In this study, we developed a technology that used high intensity focused ultrasound to assist laser treatment in the removal of the lipid core of atherosclerotic plaques.<i>Approach</i>. The fundamental mechanism to disrupt atherosclerostic plaque was to enhance the mechanical effect of cavitation during laser/ultrasound therapy. To promote cavitation, spatiotemporally synchronized ultrasound bursts of 2% duty cycle at 0.5 MHz and nanosecond laser pulses at 532 nm wavelength were used. Experiments were first performed on pig belly fat samples to titrate ultrasound and laser parameters. Then, experiments were conducted on human plaque samples, where the lipid depositions of the plaques were targeted.<i>Main results</i>. Our results showed that fat tissue could be removed with an ultrasound peak negative pressure (PNP) of 2.45 MPa and a laser radiant exposure as low as 3.2 mJ mm<sup>-2</sup>. The lipid depositions on the atherosclerostic plaques were removed with laser radiant exposure of 16 mJ mm<sup>-2</sup>in synchronizing with an ultrasound PNP of 5.4 MPa. During all the experiments, laser-only and ultrasound-only control treatments at the same energy levels were not effective in removing the lipid.<i>Significance</i>. The results demonstrated that the addition of ultrasound could effectively reduce the needed laser power for atherosclerotic plaque removal, which will potentially improve treatment safety and efficiency of current laser therapies.","Animals|Feasibility Studies|Humans|Laser Therapy|Lasers|Lipids|Plaque, Atherosclerotic|Swine|atherosclerosis|cavitation|excimer laser coronary angioplasty|ultrasound","Singh, Rohit|Ebersole, Koji C|Yang, Xinmai",Physics in medicine and biology,2023,2023-02-21,Journal Article,HL152410,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We characterized variation in initial treatment with anakinra and evaluated cardiovascular outcomes associated with adding anakinra to standard initial therapy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of MIS-C cases in a US surveillance registry from November 2020 to December 2021. Day 0 was the first calendar day of immunomodulatory treatment. Factors associated with initial anakinra use (days 0-1) were identified. We compared cases in patients ages 2-20 years receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids versus anakinra plus IVIG and/or glucocorticoids on days 0-1, using inverse probability weighting to balance disease severity. Primary outcomes were vasopressor requirement on day 3 and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction on days 3-4. The secondary outcome was 50% reduction in C-reactive protein on day 3. Among 1,516 MIS-C cases at 44 sites, 193 (13%) patients received anakinra alone or with other immunomodulators as initial treatment (range 0-74% by site). Site accounted for 59% of residual variance in anakinra use. After balancing disease severity, initial treatment with anakinra plus IVIG and/or glucocorticoids (n = 121) versus IVIG plus glucocorticoids (n = 389) was not associated with significant differences in vasopressor requirement (25.6% versus 20.1%, respectively; risk ratio [RR] 1.27 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.88-1.84]), ventricular dysfunction (33.7% versus 25.7%, respectively; RR 1.31 [95% CI 0.98-1.75]), or C-reactive protein reduction. We identified substantial variation in initial anakinra use in a real-world population of children with MIS-C, but no average short-term improvement in cardiovascular outcomes associated with early addition of anakinra to IVIG and/or glucocorticoids compared to IVIG and glucocorticoids alone.","C-Reactive Protein|COVID-19|Child|Connective Tissue Diseases|Glucocorticoids|Humans|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein|Retrospective Studies|Stroke Volume|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|Ventricular Function, Left","Chang, Joyce C|Young, Cameron C|Muscal, Eyal|Sexson Tejtel, Sara K|Newhams, Margaret M|Kucukak, Suden|Crandall, Hillary|Maddux, Aline B|Rowan, Courtney M|Halasa, Natasha B|Harvey, Helen A|Hobbs, Charlotte V|Hall, Mark W|Kong, Michele|Aguiar, Cassyanne L|Schuster, Jennifer E|Fitzgerald, Julie C|Singh, Aalok R|Wellnitz, Kari|Nofziger, Ryan A|Cvijanovich, Natalie Z|Mack, Elizabeth H|Schwarz, Adam J|Heidemann, Sabrina M|Newburger, Jane W|Zambrano, Laura D|Campbell, Angela P|Patel, Manish M|Randolph, Adrienne G|Son, Mary Beth F|","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2023,2023-08-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

While many drugs reduce gastrointestinal injury, no drug directly stimulates mucosal wound healing. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, induces epithelial sheet migration. We synthesized and evaluated a water-soluble FAK-activating small molecule, M64HCl, with drug-like properties. Monolayer wound closure and Western blots measured migration and FAK phosphorylation in Caco-2 ​cells, in vitro kinase assays established FAK activation, and pharmacologic tests assessed drug-like properties. 30 ​mg/kg/day M64HCl was administered in two murine small intestine injury models for 4 days. M64HCl (0.1-1000 ​nM) dose-dependently increased Caco-2 FAK-Tyr 397 phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2 and accelerated Caco-2 monolayer wound closure. M64HCl dose-responsively activates the FAK kinase domain vs. the non-salt M64, increasing the V<sub>max</sub> of ATP-binding. Pharmacologic tests suggested M64HCl has drug-like properties and is enterally absorbed. M64HCl 25 ​mg/kg/day continuous infusion promoted healing of ischemic jejunal ulcers and indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury in C57Bl/6 mice. M64HCl-treated mice exhibited smaller ulcers 4 days after ischemic ulcer induction or indomethacin injury. Renal histology and plasma creatinine were normal. Mild hepatic inflammatory changes and ALT elevation were similar among M64HCl-treated mice and controls. M64HCl was concentrated in kidney and gastrointestinal mucosa and functional nephrectomy studies suggested predominantly urinary excretion. Little toxicity was observed in vitro or in single-dose mouse toxicity studies until >1000x higher than effective concentrations.

Here, we report the design, implementation, and characterization of a compact Photonic Resonator Interferometric Scattering Microscope (PRISM) designed for point-of-use environments and applications. The contrast of interferometric scattering microscopy is amplified through a photonic crystal surface, upon which scattered light from an object combines with illumination from a monochromatic source. The use of a photonic crystal substrate for interferemetric scattering microscopy results in reduced requirements for high-intensity lasers or oil-immersion objectives, thus opening a pathway toward instruments that are more suitable for environments outside the optics laboratory. The instrument incorporates two innovative elements that facilitate operation on a desktop in ordinary laboratory environments by users that do not have optics expertise. First, because scattering microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration, we incorporated an inexpensive but effective solution of suspending the instrument's main components from a rigid metal framework using elastic bands, resulting in an average of 28.7 dBV reduction in vibration amplitude compared to an office desk. Second, an automated focusing module based on the principle of total internal reflection maintains the stability of image contrast over time and spatial position. In this work, we characterize the system's performance by measuring the contrast from gold nanoparticles with diameters in the 10-40 nm range and by observing various biological analytes, including HIV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosome, and ferritin protein.",Automated focusing|Biosensing Techniques|COVID-19|Gold|Humans|Interferometric scattering microscopy|Label-free|Metal Nanoparticles|Microscopy|Nanoparticles|Photonic crystals|SARS-CoV-2|Vibration isolation,"Liu, Leyang|Tibbs, Joseph|Li, Nantao|Bacon, Amanda|Shepherd, Skye|Lee, Hankeun|Chauhan, Neha|Demirci, Utkan|Wang, Xing|Cunningham, Brian T",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2023,2023-05-15,Journal Article,AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

However, typical imaging systems suffer from spatial and spectral non-uniformity due to non-ideal optical elements, thus require complex solutions for illumination corrections. We present Effective Uniform Color-Light Integration Device (EUCLID), a simple and cost-effective illumination source for uniformity corrections. EUCLID employs a diffuse-reflective, adjustable hollow cavity that allows for uniform mixing of light from discrete light sources and modifies the source field distribution to compensate for spatial non-uniformity introduced by optical components in the imaging system. In this study, we characterize the light coupling efficiency of the proposed design and compare the uniformity performance with the conventional method.

Debate therefore persists even after the American Thoracic Society's 2023 guidelines recommending race-neutral pulmonary function test (PFT) result interpretation strategies. Advocates of race-based PFT results interpretation argue that it allows for more precise measurement and will minimize disease misclassification. In contrast, recent studies have shown that low lung function in Black patients has clinical consequences. Furthermore, the use of race-based algorithms in medicine in general is increasingly being questioned for its risk of perpetuating structural health care disparities. Given these concerns, we believe it is time to adopt a race-neutral approach, but note that more research is urgently needed to understand how race-neutral approaches impact PFT results interpretation, clinical decision-making, and patient outcomes.

Here, we develop and characterize an ultrasensitive, highly responsive, ratiometric lactate sensor, named FiLa, enabling the monitoring of subtle lactate fluctuations in living cells and animals. Utilizing FiLa, we demonstrate that lactate is highly enriched in mammalian mitochondria and compile an atlas of subcellular lactate metabolism that reveals lactate as a key hub sensing various metabolic activities. In addition, FiLa sensors also enable direct imaging of elevated lactate levels in diabetic mice and facilitate the establishment of a simple, rapid, and sensitive lactate assay for point-of-care clinical screening. Thus, FiLa sensors provide powerful, broadly applicable tools for defining the spatiotemporal landscape of lactate metabolism in health and disease.","Animals|Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental|Lactic Acid|Mammals|Mice|Mitochondria|highly responsive lactate sensors|lactate metabolism|point-of-care clinical screening|real-time monitoring|subcellular lactate landscape","Li, Xie|Zhang, Yinan|Xu, Lingyan|Wang, Aoxue|Zou, Yejun|Li, Ting|Huang, Li|Chen, Weicai|Liu, Shuning|Jiang, Kun|Zhang, Xiuze|Wang, Dongmei|Zhang, Lijuan|Zhang, Zhuo|Zhang, Zeyi|Chen, Xianjun|Jia, Wei|Zhao, Aihua|Yan, Xinfeng|Zhou, Haimeng|Zhu, Linyong|Ma, Xinran|Ju, Zhenyu|Jia, Weiping|Wang, Congrong|Loscalzo, Joseph|Yang, Yi|Zhao, Yuzheng",Cell metabolism,2023,2023-01-03,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

While high peel-strength adhesives provide more secure skin attachment, they are difficult to remove from the skin and are correlated with medical adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears, and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to dressing or device dislodgement and further medical complications. This paper reports on the clinical testing of a new, high-adhesion medical tape, ThermoTape (University of Washington, US), designed for low skin trauma upon release. ThermoTape was benchmarked with Tegaderm (3M, US) and Kind Removal Tape (KRT) (3M, US). All three tapes were applied to both the left and right forearm of healthy volunteers and were removed 24 hours later-the right arm without applying heat and the left arm by applying a heat pack for 30 seconds before removal. Tape wear, self-reported pain (0-10 scale) and skin redness 15 minutes after removal were recorded. This was a 53-subject comparative, single-blind clinical trial. There were clinically and statistically significant results supporting reduced pain during removal of ThermoTape with warming, with an average 58% decrease in pain, paired with a statistically significant 45% reduction in skin redness (p<0.01 for both values). In contrast, there were statistically insignificant differences in pain and redness for removal of Tegaderm and KRT with warming. ThermoTape after warming, in comparison with Tegaderm without warming, produced a reduced pain score of >1 on the 0-10 Wong-Baker/Face pain scale, which was statistically significant (p<0.01). These results provide compelling evidence that warming ThermoTape prior to removal can reduce pain and injury when compared with standard medical tapes.

With acoustic tweezers, users can conduct versatile experiments that require the trapping, patterning, pairing and separation of single cells in a myriad of applications ranging across the biological and biomedical sciences. This procedure is widely generalizable and adaptable for investigations in materials and physical sciences, such as the spinning motion of colloids or the development of acoustic-based quantum simulations.

Pharmacologic interactions between established asthma therapies and novel drug interventions for COVID-19 infection, including antivirals, biologics, and vaccines, have emerged as a critical and unanticipated issue in the clinical care of asthma. In particular, impaired metabolism of some long-acting beta-2 agonists by the cytochrome P4503A4 enzyme in the setting of antiviral treatment using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (NVM/r, brand name Paxlovid) may increase risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Although available data have documented the potential for such interactions, these issues are largely unappreciated by clinicians who treat asthma, or those dispensing COVID-19 interventions in patients who happen to have asthma. Because these drug-drug interactions have not previously been relevant to patient care, clinicians have had no guidance on management strategies to reduce potentially serious interactions between treatments for asthma and COVID-19.

Loss of taste is possible but rare with these illnesses, and patient reports of 'taste loss' typically arise from a taste / flavor confusion. Thus, initial reports from COVID-19 patients of loss of taste and chemesthesis (i.e., chemical somatosensation like warming or cooling) were met with skepticism until multiple studies confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections could disrupt these senses. Many studies have been based on self-report or on single time point assessments after acute illness was ended. Here, we describe intensive longitudinal data over 28 days from adults aged 18-45 years recruited in early 2021 (i.e., prior to the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 waves). These individuals were either COVID-19 positive or close contacts (per U.S. CDC criteria at the time of the study) in the first half of 2021. Upon enrollment, all participants were given nose clips, blinded samples of commercial jellybeans (Sour Cherry and Cinnamon), and scratch-n-sniff odor identification test cards (ScentCheckPro), which they used for daily assessments. In COVID-19 cases who enrolled on or before Day 10 of infection, Gaussian Process Regression showed two distinct measures of function - odor identification and odor intensity - declined relative to controls (exposed individuals who never developed COVID-19). Because enrollment began upon exposure, some participants became ill only after enrollment, which allowed us to capture baseline ratings, onset of loss, and recovery. Data from these four cases and four age- and sex- matched controls were plotted over 28 days to create panel plots. Variables included mean orthonasal intensity of four odors (ScentCheckPro), perceived nasal blockage, oral burn (Cinnamon jellybeans), and sourness and sweetness (Sour Cherry jellybeans). Controls exhibited stable ratings over time. By contrast, COVID-19 cases showed sharp deviations over time. Changes in odor intensity or odor identification were not explained by nasal blockage. No single pattern of taste loss or recovery was apparent, implying different taste qualities might recover at different rates. Oral burn was transiently reduced for some before recovering quickly, suggesting acute loss may be missed in datasets collected only after illness ends. Collectively, intensive daily testing shows orthonasal smell, oral chemesthesis and taste were each altered by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This disruption was dyssynchronous for different modalities, with variable loss and recovery rates across both modalities and individuals.",Adult|Ageusia|Anosmia|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Gustation|Humans|Longitudinal|Nasal Obstruction|Olfaction|Olfaction Disorders|Recovery|SARS-CoV-2|Smell|Taste|Taste Disorders|Trigeminal,"Weir, Elisabeth M|Exten, Cara|Gerkin, Richard C|Munger, Steven D|Hayes, John E",Physiology & behavior,2023,2023-11-01,Journal Article,DC019573,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

To overcome this barrier, we have developed an acoustofluidic scanning fluorescence nanoscope that can simultaneously achieve superior resolution, a large field of view, and enhanced fluorescent signal. The acoustofluidic scanning fluorescence nanoscope utilizes the super-resolution capability of microspheres that are controlled by a programable acoustofluidic device for rapid fluorescent enhancement and imaging.

Genetic manipulations that delete or inactivate the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme confer protection against aortic stiffness induced by chronic ingestion of high-salt water (4%NaCl in drinking water for 3 weeks) or associated with aging. Therefore, there is heightened interest in identifying interventions capable of inhibiting translin/trax RNase activity, as these may have therapeutic efficacy in large-artery stiffness. Methods and Results Activation of neuronal adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>Rs) triggers dissociation of trax from its C-terminus. As A<sub>2A</sub>Rs are expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we investigated whether stimulation of A<sub>2A</sub>R on vascular smooth muscle cells promotes the association of translin with trax and, thereby increases translin/trax complex activity. We found that treatment of A7r5 cells with the A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist CGS21680 leads to increased association of trax with translin. Furthermore, this treatment decreases levels of pre-microRNA-181b, a target of translin/trax, and those of its downstream product, mature microRNA-181b. To check whether A<sub>2A</sub>R activation might contribute to high-salt water-induced aortic stiffening, we assessed the impact of daily treatment with the selective A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist SCH58261 in this paradigm. We found that this treatment blocked aortic stiffening induced by high-salt water. Further, we confirmed that the age-associated decline in aortic pre-microRNA-181b/microRNA-181b levels observed in mice also occurs in humans. Conclusions These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether blockade of A<sub>2A</sub>Rs may have therapeutic potential in treating large-artery stiffness.","Adenosine|Animals|Aorta|Carrier Proteins|DNA-Binding Proteins|Humans|Mice|MicroRNAs|Receptor, Adenosine A2A|Water|adenosine A2A receptor|microRNA|microRNA degradation|microRNA‐181b|translin/trax|vascular stiffness","Akiyoshi, Kei|Fujimori, Tomonari|Fu, Xiuping|Shah, Aparna P|Yamaguchi, Atsushi|Steenbergen, Charles|Santhanam, Lakshmi|Berkowitz, Dan|Tuday, Eric|Baraban, Jay M|Das, Samarjit",Journal of the American Heart Association,2023,2023-07-18,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",TR003780,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Those multi-functional nanomaterials have been utilized to treat neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system (CNS) injuries in an effective and personalized manner. Even though many nanomaterials can deliver a payload and detect a biomarker of interest, only a few studies have yet to fully utilize this combined strategy to its full potential. Combining a nanomaterial's ability to facilitate targeted delivery, promote cellular proliferation and differentiation, and carry a large amount of material with various sensing approaches makes it possible to diagnose a patient selectively and sensitively while offering preventative measures or early disease-modifying strategies. By tuning the properties of an inorganic nanomaterial, the dimensionality, hydrophilicity, size, charge, shape, surface chemistry, and many other chemical and physical parameters, different types of cells in the central nervous system can be monitored, modulated, or further studies to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms. Scientists and clinicians have better understood the underlying processes of pathologies for many neurologically related diseases and injuries by implementing multi-dimensional 0D, 1D, and 2D theragnostic nanomaterials.

However, surveillance has been largely limited to clinically manifest cases, resulting in a dearth of CPV genomic information on virus type, abundance, and diversity, limiting our understanding of its evolutionary dynamics. We tested the feasibility of using dog feces in poop bags collected from outdoor waste bins as a source for environmental surveillance of CPV. After polymerase chain reaction, long-read sequencing, and bioinformatics, we identified that CPV-2c was present in Arizona, USA, in June 2022 and documented variants with amino acid substitutions 530E and 101K in NS1 and NS2, respectively. Based on publicly available sequence data in GenBank as of January 2023, the CPV genome described here represents the only CPV genome described in the USA from the 2022 season, despite news of CPV outbreak-associated fatalities in dogs in the USA.

We sought to characterize early or late onset atopic asthma with fungal or non-fungal sensitization (AAFS or AANFS) and non-atopic asthma (NAA) in children and adults in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). SARP is an ongoing project involving well-phenotyped patients with mild to severe asthma. Phenotypic comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis or chi-square test. Genetic association analyses were performed using logistic or linear regression. Airway hyper-responsiveness, total serum IgE levels, and T2 biomarkers showed an increasing trend from NAA to AANFS and then to AAFS. Children and adults with early onset asthma had greater % of AAFS than adults with late onset asthma (46% and 40% vs. 32%; <i>P</i> < 0.00001). In children, AAFS and AANFS had lower % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (86% and 91% vs. 97%) and greater % of patients with severe asthma than NAA (61% and 59% vs. 43%). In adults with early or late onset asthma, NAA had greater % of patients with severe asthma than AANFS and AAFS (61% vs. 40% and 37% or 56% vs. 44% and 49%). The G allele of rs2872507 in <i>GSDMB</i> had higher frequency in AAFS than AANFS and NAA (0.63 vs. 0.55 and 0.55), and associated with earlier age onset and asthma severity.

Currently, air cleaning technologies lack an accepted test standard to evaluate their VOC removal performance. A protocol to evaluate the VOC removal performance of air cleaning devices was developed and piloted with two devices. This method injects a VOC mixture and carbon dioxide into a test chamber, supplies outdoor air at a standard building ventilation rate, periodically measures the VOC concentrations in the chamber using solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry over a 3-h decay period, and compares the decay rate of VOCs to carbon dioxide to measure the VOC removal air cleaning performance. The method was demonstrated with both a hydroxyl radical generator and an activated carbon air cleaner.

Direct, non-invasive screening of respiratory virus aerosols in patients has been a long-standing technical challenge. Here, we introduce a point-of-care testing platform that directly detects SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in as little as two exhaled breaths of patients and provides results in under 60 s. It integrates a hand-held breath aerosol collector and a llama-derived, SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein specific nanobody bound to an ultrasensitive micro-immunoelectrode biosensor, which detects the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids present in SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Laboratory and clinical trial results were within 20% of those obtained using standard testing methods. Importantly, the electrochemical biosensor directly detects the virus itself, as opposed to a surrogate or signature of the virus, and is sensitive to as little as 10 viral particles in a sample.

Advances in scientific knowledge have made it clear that miRNAs play a vital role in regulating cellular physiology throughout the human body. Perturbations in miRNA signaling have also been described in a variety of pediatric conditions-from cancer, to renal failure, to traumatic brain injury. Likewise, the number of studies across pediatric disciplines that pair patient miRNA-omics with longitudinal clinical data are growing. Analyses of these voluminous, multivariate data sets require understanding of pediatric phenotypic data, data science, and genomics. Use of machine learning techniques to aid in biomarker detection have helped decipher background noise from biologically meaningful changes in the data. Further, emerging research suggests that miRNAs may have potential as therapeutic targets for pediatric precision care.

We compared the risk of serious infections (safety) and all-cause hospitalization and inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery (effectiveness) between different biologic classes using propensity score (PS) matching. As compared with TNF-α antagonists (n = 1030), 2:1 PS-matched, ustekinumab-treated patients with CD (n = 515) experienced a lower risk of serious infections (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.64), without any difference in the risk of hospitalization (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.89-1.21) or surgery (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.69-1.70).

Herein, we present design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called the ""NanoGripper"", that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages evolved in nature. Each NanoGripper finger has three phalanges connected by two flexible and rotatable joints that are bendable in response to binding to other entities. Functions of the NanoGripper have been enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We showcase that the NanoGripper can be engineered to interact with and capture various objects with different dimensions, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. When carrying multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate fluorescent signal enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a sensitive viral biosensor that detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ~ 100 copies/mL, providing RT-PCR equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we use confocal microscopy to visualize how the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, indicating the viral inhibition.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) - a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study.

Here, using a hierarchy of computational techniques, we design a cyclic peptide that binds CTLA4 and follow this with experimental verification of binding and biological activity, using bio-layer interferometry, cell culture, and a mouse tumor model. Beginning from a template excised from the X-ray structure of the CTLA4:B7-2 complex, we generate several peptide sequences using flexible docking and modeling steps. These peptides are cyclized head-to-tail to improve structural and proteolytic stability and screened using molecular dynamics simulation and MM-GBSA calculation. The standard binding free energies for shortlisted peptides are then calculated in explicit-solvent simulation using a rigorous multistep technique. The most promising peptide, cyc(EIDTVLTPTGWVAKRYS), yields the standard free energy -6.6 ± 3.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponds to a dissociation constant of ∼15 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>. The binding affinity of this peptide for CTLA4 is measured experimentally (31 ± 4 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>) using bio-layer interferometry.

Influent 24-hour composite wastewater samples were collected from July to December 2020 from two municipal wastewater treatment plants serving different population sizes in Orange and Chatham Counties in North Carolina. After a concentration step via HA filtration, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected and quantified by reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), targeting the N1 and N2 nucleocapsid genes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-ddPCR in 100 % (24/24) and 79 % (19/24) of influent wastewater samples from the larger and smaller plants, respectively. In comparison, viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in 41.7 % (10/24) and 8.3 % (2/24) of samples from the larger and smaller plants, respectively. Positivity rates and method agreement further increased for the RT-qPCR assay when samples with positive signals below the limit of detection were counted as positive. The wastewater data from the larger plant generally correlated (⍴ ~0.5, p < 0.05) with, and even anticipated, the trends in reported COVID-19 cases, with a notable spike in measured viral RNA preceding a spike in cases when students returned to a college campus in the Orange County sewershed. Correlations were generally higher when using estimates of sewershed-level case data rather than county-level data.

Fluorescent signals are generated when multivalent aptamer-spike binding releases fluorescent quenchers, resulting in rapid (5-min) generation of dose-dependent output. The V-Pod instrument performs laser excitation, fluorescence intensity quantitation, and secure transmission of data to an App via Bluetooth™. We show that the V-Pod and DNA Net assay achieves clinically relevant detection limits of 3.92 × 10<sup>3</sup> viral-genome-copies/mL for pseudo-typed wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and 1.84 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 9.69 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 6.99 × 10<sup>4</sup> viral-genome-copies/mL for pathogenic Delta, Omicron, and D614G variants, representing sensitivity similar to laboratory-based PCR. The pocket-sized instrument (∼$294), inexpensive reagent-cost/test ($1.26), single-step, rapid sample-to-answer, and quantitative output represent a capability that is compatible with the needs of frequent self-testing in a consumer-friendly format that can link with medical service systems such as healthcare providers, contact tracing, and infectious disease reporting.",Biosensing Techniques|Biosensor|COVID-19|COVID-19 testing|DNA|Designer DNA Nanostructure|Humans|Point-of-care test|Portable fluorometer|SARS-CoV-2|Sensitivity and Specificity|Smartphone,"Lee, Hankeun|Wang, Weijing|Chauhan, Neha|Xiong, Yanyu|Magazine, Nicholas|Valdescruz, Owen|Kim, Dong Yeun|Qiu, Tianjie|Huang, Weishan|Wang, Xing|Cunningham, Brian T",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2023,2023-06-01,Journal Article,AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Previously, we clinically validated a saliva-based RT-qPCR diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 to provide low-cost testing with high throughput and low turnaround time on a university campus. Here, we developed a respiratory diagnostic panel to detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B within a single saliva sample. When compared to clinical results, our assay demonstrated 93.5% accuracy for influenza A samples (43/46 concordant results) with no effect on SARS-CoV-2 accuracy or limit of detection. In addition, our assay can detect simulated coinfections at varying virus concentrations generated from synthetic RNA controls. We also confirmed the stability of influenza A in saliva at room temperature for up to 5 days. The cost of the assay is lower than standard nasopharyngeal swab respiratory panel tests as saliva collection does not require specialized swabs or trained clinical personnel. By repurposing the lab infrastructure developed for the COVID-19 pandemic, our multiplex assay can be used to provide expanded access to respiratory disease diagnostics, especially for community, school, or university testing applications where saliva testing was effectively utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.","COVID-19|Communicable Diseases|Humans|Influenza, Human|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Universities|flu|influenza|saliva|surveillance testing|virus","King, Kylie L|Ham, Rachel|Smothers, Austin|Lee, Isaac|Bowie, Tyler|Teetsel, Erika|Peng, Congyue|Dean, Delphine",Frontiers in public health,2023,2023-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",AA029328,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Abnormalities in skeletal muscle (SM) metabolism have been identified in patients with HF. However, the underlying mechanisms of IR development in SM in HF are poorly understood. Herein, we hypothesize that HF upregulates miR-133b in SM and in turn alters glucose metabolism and the propensity toward IR. Mitochondria isolated from SM of mice with HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) showed lower respiration and downregulation of muscle-specific components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1), and fumarate compared with those from control animals. RNA-Seq and subsequent qPCR validation confirmed upregulation of SM-specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-133b, in TAC versus sham animals. miR-133b overexpression alone resulted in significantly lower mitochondrial respiration, cellular glucose uptake, and glycolysis along with lower ATP production and cellular energy reserve compared with the scramble (Scr) in C2C12 cells. miR-133b binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of <i>KLF15</i>, the transcription factor for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4. Overexpression of miR-133b lowers GLUT4 and lowers pAkt in presence of insulin in C2C12 cells. Finally, lowering miR-133b in primary skeletal myocytes isolated from TAC mice using antagomir-133b reversed the changes in KLF15, GLUT4, and AMPD1 compared with the scramble-transfected myocytes. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for SM miR-133b in altered glucose metabolism in HF and suggest the therapeutic potential in HF to improve glucose uptake and glycolysis by restoring GLUT4 abundance. The data uncover a novel mechanism for IR and ultimately SM metabolic abnormalities in patients with HF.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Heart failure is associated with systemic insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the skeletal muscle, the major peripheral site of glucose utilization, we observe an increase in miR-133b in heart failure mice, which reduces the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4), glucose uptake, and metabolism in C2C12 and in myocytes. The antagomir for miR-133b restores GLUT4 protein and markers of metabolism in skeletal myocytes from heart failure mice demonstrating that miR-133b is an exciting target for systemic insulin resistance in heart failure and an important player in the cross talk between the heart and the periphery in the heart failure syndrome.","Animals|Antagomirs|Glucose|Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative|Glucose Transporter Type 4|Heart Failure|Insulin|Insulin Resistance|Mice|MicroRNAs|Muscle, Skeletal|heart failure|miR-133b|microRNA|mitochondria|skeletal muscle","Velasquez, Fernanda Carrizo|Roman, Barbara|Hernández-Ochoa, Erick O|Leppo, Michelle K|Truong, Sharon K|Steenbergen, Charles|Schneider, Martin F|Weiss, Robert G|Das, Samarjit",American journal of physiology.

Its unparalleled sensitivity and compatibility with intricate biological samples make it an ideal candidate for revolutionizing noninvasive diagnostic methods. However, a significant challenge that mars its efficacy is the throughput limitation, primarily anchored in the prerequisite of hotspot and sEV colocalization within a minuscule range. This paper delves deep into this issue, introducing a never-attempted-before approach which harnesses the principles of crystallization-nucleation and growth. By synergistically coupling lasers with plasmonic resonances, we navigate the challenges associated with the analyte droplet drying method and the notorious coffee ring effect. Our method, rooted in a profound understanding of crystallization's materials science, exhibits the potential to significantly increase the areal density of accessible plasmonic hotspots and efficiently guide exosomes to defined regions. In doing so, we not only overcome the throughput challenge but also promise a paradigm shift in the arena of minimally invasive biosensing, ushering in advanced diagnostic capabilities for life-threatening diseases.","Biomarkers|Biosensing Techniques|Exosomes|SERS|Sodium Chloride|Spectrum Analysis, Raman|biosensing|crystallization|extracellular vesicles|nucleation|plasmonics","Srivastava, Siddharth|Terai, Yusuke|Liu, Jun|Capellini, Giovanni|Xie, Ya-Hong",Biosensors,2023,2023-12-06,Journal Article,TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Our pre-registered cross-sectional study design included an online survey in 12 languages with instructions for self-administering chemosensory tests with 10 household items. Between June 2020 and March 2021, 10,953 individuals participated. Of these, 5,225 self-reported a respiratory illness and were grouped based on their reported COVID test results: COVID-positive (COVID+, N = 3,356), COVID-negative (COVID-, N = 602), and COVID unknown for those waiting for a test result (COVID?, N = 1,267). The participants who reported no respiratory illness were grouped by symptoms: sudden smell/taste changes (STC, N = 4,445), other symptoms excluding smell or taste changes (OthS, N = 832), and no symptoms (NoS, N = 416). Taste, smell, and oral irritation intensities and self-assessed abilities were rated on visual analog scales. Compared to the NoS group, COVID+ was associated with a 21% reduction in taste (95% confidence interval (CI): 15-28%), 47% in smell (95% CI: 37-56%), and 17% in oral irritation (95% CI: 10-25%) intensity. There were medium to strong correlations between perceived intensities and self-reported abilities (r = 0.84 for smell, r = 0.68 for taste, and r = 0.37 for oral irritation). Our study demonstrates that COVID-19-positive individuals report taste dysfunction when self-tested with stimuli that have little to none olfactory components. Assessing the smell and taste intensity of household items is a promising, cost-effective screening tool that complements self-reports and may help to disentangle taste loss from smell loss.

In this regard, leveraging big data-omics analyses using innovative approaches that integrate network medicine and machine learning correlated with clinically useful indices or risk stratification scores is an approach well-positioned to advance PAH precision medicine. For example, machine learning applied to a panel of 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors could prognosticate PAH patients with immune-dominant subphenotypes at elevated or low-risk for mortality. Here, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the most current studies evaluating omics-derived biomarkers in PAH. Progress in this field is offset by studies with small sample size, pervasive limitations in bioinformatics, and lack of standardized methods for data processing and interpretation.

The average duration of symptoms for CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (8.5 ± 10 days) did not differ from that of CYP with a negative test (7.2 ± 5 days, <i>P</i> = .71, d = 0.046). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test did not increase the risk (36/372, 10%) of symptoms persisting for ≥3 weeks (odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.45-2.0).

We used metagenomic sequencing, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, and culturing to profile the microbial and volatile chemical constituents of anal gland secretions in twenty-three domestic cats (Felis catus), in attempts to identify organisms potentially involved in host odor production. We found that the anal gland microbiome was dominated by bacteria in the genera Corynebacterium, Bacteroides, Proteus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus, and showed striking variation among individual cats. Microbiome profiles also varied with host age and obesity. Metabolites such as fatty-acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols were detected in glandular secretions. Overall, microbiome and metabolome profiles were modestly correlated (r = 0.17), indicating that a relationship exists between the bacteria in the gland and the metabolites produced in the gland. Functional analyses revealed the presence of genes predicted to code for enzymes involved in VOC metabolism such as dehydrogenases, reductases, and decarboxylases.

Climate change is fueled by industrialization and the emission of greenhouse gases and leads to a range of effects, such as the redistribution of disease vectors, higher risks of disease transmission, and shifts in disease patterns. Rising temperatures pose risks to both food supplies and respiratory health. The hypothesis addressed is that environmental stressors including a spectrum of chemical and pathogen exposures as well as physical and psychological influences collectively impact genetics, metabolism, and cellular functions affecting physical and mental health. The objective is to report the mechanistic associations linking environment and health. As environmental stressors intensify, a surge in health conditions, spanning from allergies to neurodegenerative diseases, becomes evident; however, linkage to genetic-altered proteomics is more hidden. Investigations positing that environmental stressors cause mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress, which affect missense variants and neuro- and immuno-disorders, are reported. These disruptions to homeostasis with dyslipidemia and misfolded and aggregated proteins increase susceptibility to cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases. Proposed interventions, such as vitamin B supplements and antioxidants, target oxidative stress and may aid mitochondrial respiration and immune balance.

Saliva microRNAs were quantified with RNA sequencing. Data on 197 infected children (severe = 45) were analyzed. Of the known human miRNAs, 1606 (60%) were measured and compared across saliva samples. There were 43 miRNAs with ≥2-fold difference between severe and non-severe cases (adjusted <i>p</i>-value < 0.05). The majority (31/43) were downregulated in severe cases. The largest between-group differences involved miR-4495, miR-296-5p, miR-548ao-3p and miR-1273c. These microRNAs displayed enrichment for 32 gene ontology pathways including viral processing and transforming growth factor beta and Fc-gamma receptor signaling. In conclusion, salivary miRNA levels are perturbed in children with severe COVID-19, with the majority of miRNAs being down regulated. Further studies are required to validate and determine the utility of salivary miRNAs as biomarkers of severe COVID-19.",COVID-19|Child|Humans|MicroRNAs|SARS-CoV-2|Saliva|Signal Transduction|children|miRNA|saliva,"Hicks, Steven D|Zhu, Dongxiao|Sullivan, Rhea|Kannikeswaran, Nirupama|Meert, Kathleen|Chen, Wei|Suresh, Srinivasan|Sethuraman, Usha",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,2023-05-03,Journal Article,HD105610,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

In other solution conditions tested for DNA nanostructure assembly, only a limited set of divalent and monovalent ions are used so far (typically Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ). Here, we investigate the assembly of DNA nanostructures in a wide variety of ions using nanostructures of different sizes: a double-crossover motif (76 bp), a three-point-star motif (~134 bp), a DNA tetrahedron (534 bp) and a DNA origami triangle (7221 bp). We show successful assembly of a majority of these structures in Ca<sup>2+</sup> , Ba<sup>2+</sup> , Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> and provide quantified assembly yields using gel electrophoresis and visual confirmation of a DNA origami triangle using atomic force microscopy. We further show that structures assembled in monovalent ions (Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> ) exhibit up to a 10-fold higher nuclease resistance compared to those assembled in divalent ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup> , Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> ).

There is limited consensus on conserved microbiome changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with many studies focusing on severely ill individuals. This study aimed to assess the variation in the upper respiratory tract microbiome using saliva specimens in a cohort of individuals with primarily mild to moderate disease. In early 2020, a cohort of 831 adults without known SARS-CoV-2 infection was followed over a six-month period to assess the occurrence and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From this cohort, 81 participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with 57 unexposed counterparts were selected with a total of 748 serial saliva samples were collected for analysis. Total bacterial abundance, composition, population structure, and gene function of the salivary microbiome were measured using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The salivary microbiome remained stable in unexposed individuals over the six-month study period, as evidenced by all measured metrics. Similarly, participants with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection showed microbiome stability throughout and after their infection. However, there were significant reductions in microbiome diversity among SARS-CoV-2-positive participants with severe symptoms early after infection. Over time, the microbiome diversity in these participants showed signs of recovery. These findings demonstrate the resilience of the salivary microbiome in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild to moderate infections did not significantly disrupt the stability of the salivary microbiome, suggesting its ability to maintain its composition and function. However, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with temporary reductions in microbiome diversity, indicating the limits of microbiome resilience in the face of severe infection. This project was supported in part by Danone North America and grants from the National Institutes of Health, United States.","Adult|COVID-19|Humans|Microbiome|Microbiota|Prospective Studies|RNA, Ribosomal, 16S|SARS-CoV-2|Saliva|Upper respiratory track","Armstrong, Abigail J S|Horton, Daniel B|Andrews, Tracy|Greenberg, Patricia|Roy, Jason|Gennaro, Maria Laura|Carson, Jeffrey L|Panettieri, Reynold A|Barrett, Emily S|Blaser, Martin J",EBioMedicine,2023,2023-08-01,Journal Article,HD105619,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Here, we report a main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>)-responsive, mitochondrial-targeting, and modular-peptide-conjugated probe (PSGMR) for selective imaging and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells via enzyme-instructed self-assembly and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect. The amphiphilic PSGMR was constructed with tunable structure and responsive efficiency and validated with recombinant proteins, cells transfected with M<sup>pro</sup> plasmid or infected by SARS-CoV-2, and a M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor. By rational construction of AIE luminogen (AIEgen) with modular peptides and M<sup>pro</sup>, we verified that the cleavage of PSGMR yielded gradual aggregation with bright fluorescence and enhanced cytotoxicity to induce mitochondrial interference of the infected cells.

Benefiting from the facile synthesis and chemical modification strategies, MNPs have been widely studied for applications in nanomedicine. Herein, we firstly summarized the designs of MNPs from the perspectives of materials and physicochemical properties tailored for biomedical applications. Magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), first reported in 2006, has flourished as an independent platform for many biological and biomedical applications. It has been extensively reported as a versatile platform for a variety of bioassays along with the artificially designed MNPs, where the MNPs serve as magnetic nanoprobes to specifically probe target analytes from fluid samples. In this review, the mechanisms and theories of different MPS platforms realizing volumetric- and surface-based bioassays are discussed. Some representative works of MPS platforms for applications such as disease diagnosis, food safety and plant pathology monitoring, drug screening, thrombus maturity assessments are reviewed. At the end of this review, we commented on the rapid growth and booming of MPS-based bioassays in its first 15 years.

In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases. This study shows that a real-time alerting system can be used for early detection of infection and other stressors and employed on an open-source platform that is scalable to millions of users.","Accelerometry|Adolescent|Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|COVID-19|Carrier State|Early Diagnosis|Exercise|Female|Fitness Trackers|Heart Rate|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|SARS-CoV-2|Sleep|Wearable Electronic Devices|Young Adult","Alavi, Arash|Bogu, Gireesh K|Wang, Meng|Rangan, Ekanath Srihari|Brooks, Andrew W|Wang, Qiwen|Higgs, Emily|Celli, Alessandra|Mishra, Tejaswini|Metwally, Ahmed A|Cha, Kexin|Knowles, Peter|Alavi, Amir A|Bhasin, Rajat|Panchamukhi, Shrinivas|Celis, Diego|Aditya, Tagore|Honkala, Alexander|Rolnik, Benjamin|Hunting, Erika|Dagan-Rosenfeld, Orit|Chauhan, Arshdeep|Li, Jessi W|Bejikian, Caroline|Krishnan, Vandhana|McGuire, Lettie|Li, Xiao|Bahmani, Amir|Snyder, Michael P",Nature medicine,2022,2022-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NR020105,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

This along with the benefits of multicenter research collaboratives led to the creation of the KD Arab Initiative [Kawarabi] consortium. An anonymous survey was completed among potential collaborative Arab medical institutions to assess burden of KD in those countries and resources available to physicians. An online 32-item survey was distributed to participating institutions after conducting face validity. One survey per institution was collected. Nineteen physicians from 12 countries completed the survey representing 19 out of 20 institutions (response rate of 95%). Fifteen (79%) institutions referred to the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines when managing a patient with KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not readily available at 2 institutions (11%) yet available in the country. In one center (5%), IVIG is imported on-demand. The knowledge and awareness among countries' general population was graded (0 to 10) at median/interquartiles (IQR) 3 (2-5) and at median/IQR 7 (6-8) in the medical community outside their institution. Practice variations in KD management and treatment across Arab countries require solid proactive collaboration. The low awareness and knowledge estimates about KD among the general population contrasted with a high level among the medical community. The Kawarabi collaborative will offer a platform to assess disease burden of KD, among Arab population, decrease practice variation and foster population-based knowledge.","Arab|Arabs|Cardiac complications|Humans|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Kawasaki disease|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Multicenter collaborative|Registry|Survey|Surveys and Questionnaires","Arab, Yousra|Choueiter, Nadine|Dahdah, Nagib|El-Kholy, Nermeen|Abu Al-Saoud, Sima Y|Abu-Shukair, Mohammed E|Agha, Hala M|Al-Saloos, Hesham|Al Senaidi, Khalfan Salim|Alzyoud, Raed|Bouaziz, Asma|Boukari, Rachida|El Ganzoury, Mona M|Elmarsafawy, Hala M|ELrugige, Najat|Fitouri, Zohra|Ladj, Mohamed S|Mouawad, Pierre|Salih, Aso F|Rojas, Rocio G|Harahsheh, Ashraf S",Pediatric cardiology,2022,2022-08-01,Journal Article|Multicenter Study,HD105591,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

The potassium current I<sub>A</sub> is one potential source of modulation. In the caudal NST, projection neurons with I<sub>A</sub> show lower fidelity to afferent stimulation compared to cells without. We explored the role of an A-type K+ current (I<sub>A</sub>) in modulating the response to afferent stimulation and GABA-mediated inhibition in the rNST using whole cell patch clamp recording in transgenic mice that expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2 H134R) in GABAergic neurons. The presence of I<sub>A</sub> was determined in current clamp and the response to electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the solitary tract was assessed before and after treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTX3. Blocking I<sub>A</sub> significantly increased the response to afferent stimulation by 53%. Using dynamic clamp to create a synthetic I<sub>A</sub> conductance, we demonstrated a significant 14% decrease in responsiveness to afferent stimulation in cells lacking I<sub>A</sub>. Because I<sub>A</sub> reduced excitability and is hyperpolarization-sensitive, we examined whether I<sub>A</sub> contributed to the inhibition resulting from optogenetic release of GABA. Although blocking I<sub>A</sub> decreased the percent suppression induced by GABA, this effect was attributable to the increased responsiveness resulting from AmmTX3, not to a change in the absolute magnitude of suppression. We conclude that rNST responses to afferent input are regulated independently by I<sub>A</sub> and GABA.",Animals|Electric Stimulation|GABAergic Neurons|Mice|Patch-Clamp Techniques|Solitary Nucleus|Taste|dynamic clamp|gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|inhibition|patch clamp|taste,"Chen, Z|Terman, D H|Travers, S P|Travers, J B",Neuroscience,2022,2022-07-15,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We used data from adult HD patients treated at an integrated kidney disease company who received a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to investigate suspicion of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection between May 1 and September 1, 2020. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time in patients testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 and those who survived or died within 30 days of first suspicion or positive test date. For each clinical parameter of interest, the difference in average daily changes between COVID-19 positive versus negative group and COVID-19 survivor versus nonsurvivor group was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effects model based on measurements in the 14 days before (i.e., Day -14 to Day 0) Day 0.

Monitoring of wastewater is a useful tool for assessing community prevalence given that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in high concentrations by infected individuals, regardless of whether they are asymptomatic or symptomatic. Using tools that are part of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach, combined with molecular analyses, wastewater monitoring becomes a key piece of information used to assess trends and quantify the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 infection in a specific community, municipality, or area of service. This study investigates a six-month long SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in influent wastewater from four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) serving the Charlotte region of North Carolina (NC) using both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR platforms. Influent wastewater was analyzed for the nucleocapsid (N) genes N1 and N2. Both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR performed well for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 using the N1 target, while for the N2 target RT-ddPCR was more sensitive. SARS-CoV-2 concentration ranged from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> copies/L for all four plants.

Therefore, to challenge this misconception we developed a novel microfluidic system harboring highly tunable three-dimensional EV microbioreactors (<sup>EV</sup>μBRs) to model micrometastatic EV release in breast cancer while capitalizing on the convenient, low-volume, and sterile interface provided by microfluidics. The diameter and cellular occupancy of the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs could be precisely tailored to various configurations, supporting the formation of breast cancer tumor spheroids. To immobilize the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs within a microchannel and facilitate EV extraction, oxygen inhibition in free-radical polymerization was repurposed to rapidly generate two-layer hydrodynamic traps <i>in situ</i> using a digital-micromirror device (DMD)-based ultraviolet (UV) projection system. Breast cancer tumor spheroid-derived EVs were harvested with as little as 20 μL from the microfluidic system and quantified by single-EV immunofluorescence for CD63 and CD81. Despite the low-volume extraction, differences in biomarker expression and coexpression of the tetraspanins on single EVs were observed. Furthermore, the <sup>EV</sup>μBRs were capable of recapitulating heterogeneity at a cellular and vesicular degree, indicating the utility and robustness of the microfluidic system to investigate physiologically relevant EVs in breast cancer and other disease models.",Breast Neoplasms|Cell Culture Techniques|Extracellular Vesicles|Female|Humans|Microfluidics|Microgels|Tumor Microenvironment,"Rima, Xilal Y|Zhang, Jingjing|Nguyen, Luong T H|Rajasuriyar, Aaron|Yoon, Min Jin|Chiang, Chi-Ling|Walters, Nicole|Kwak, Kwang Joo|Lee, L James|Reátegui, Eduardo",Lab on a chip,2022,2022-06-28,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",TR003807,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Researchers rate COVID-19 patients on a scale from 1 to 8 according to the severity level of COVID-19, 1 being healthy and 8 being extremely sick, based on a multitude of factors including number of clinic visits, days since the first sign of symptoms, and more. However, there are two issues with the current state of severity level designation. Firstly, there exists variation among researchers in determining these patient scores, which may lead to improper treatment. Secondly, researchers use a variety of metrics to determine patient severity level, including metrics involving plasma collection that require invasive procedures. This project aims to remedy both issues by introducing a machine learning framework that unifies severity level designations based on noninvasive saliva biomarkers.

Ym155 potently induces cell death of many types of cancer cells in preclinical studies. However, in phase II clinical trials Ym155 failed to demonstrate a significant benefit. Studies have suggested that the cytotoxic effects of Ym155 in cancer cells are not mediated by the inhibition of survivin. Understanding the mechanism by which Ym155 induces cell death would provide important insight how to improve its efficacy as a cancer therapeutic. We demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Ym155 induces cell death by localizing to the mitochondria causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Our studies suggest that Ym155 binds mitochondrial DNA leading to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, decrease in TCA cycle intermediates, and an increase in mitochondrial permeability. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial stress induced by Ym155 and other mitochondrial inhibitors activates AMP-activated kinase leading to the downregulation to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We provide first evidence that Ym155 initiates cell death by disrupting mitochondrial function.","AMP-Activated Protein Kinases|Antineoplastic Agents|Apoptosis|Bone Morphogenetic Proteins|Cell Line, Tumor|Humans|Imidazoles|Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins|Lung Neoplasms|Mitochondria|Naphthoquinones|Survivin","Mondal, Arindam|Jia, Dongxuan|Bhatt, Vrushank|Akel, Moumen|Roberge, Jacques|Guo, Jessie Yanxiang|Langenfeld, John",Scientific reports,2022,2022-07-30,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), hypoxia increases neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) and induces expression of a prothrombotic NEDD9 peptide (N9<sub>P</sub>) on the extracellular plasma membrane surface. We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2-ARDS pathophenotype involves increased pulmonary endothelial N9<sub>P</sub>. Paraffin-embedded autopsy lung specimens were acquired from patients with SARS-CoV-2-​​​​​​ARDS (<i>n</i> = 13), ARDS from other causes (<i>n</i> = 10), and organ donor controls (<i>n</i> = 5). Immunofluorescence characterized the expression of N9<sub>P</sub>, fibrin, and transcription factor 12 (TCF12), a putative binding target of SARS-CoV-2 and known transcriptional regulator of <i>NEDD9</i>. We performed RNA-sequencing on normal HPAECs treated with normoxia or hypoxia (0.2% O<sub>2</sub>) for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (IP-LC-MS) profiled protein-protein interactions involving N9<sub>P</sub> relevant to thrombus stabilization. Hypoxia increased TCF12 messenger RNA significantly compared to normoxia in HPAECs in vitro (+1.19-fold, <i>p</i> = 0.001; false discovery rate = 0.005), and pulmonary endothelial TCF12 expression was increased threefold in SARS-CoV-2-ARDS versus donor control lungs (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Compared to donor controls, pulmonary endothelial N9<sub>P</sub>-fibrin colocalization was increased in situ in non-SARS-CoV-2-ARDS and SARS-CoV-2-ARDS decedents (3.7 ± 1.2 vs. 10.3 ± 3.2 and 21.8 ± 4.0 arb. units, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, total pulmonary endothelial N9<sub>P</sub> was increased significantly only in SARS-CoV-2-ARDS versus donor controls (15 ± 4.2 vs. 6.3 ± 0.9 arb. units, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In HPAEC plasma membrane isolates, IP-LC-MS identified a novel protein-protein interaction between NEDD9 and the β<sub>3</sub>-subunit of the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin, which regulates fibrin anchoring to endothelial cells. In conclusion, lethal SARS-CoV-2-ARDS is associated with increased pulmonary endothelial N9<sub>P</sub> expression and N9<sub>P</sub>-fibrin colocalization in situ.

Purpose To determine whether quantitative CT (qCT) could help distinguish between clinical asthma phenotypes. Materials and Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted with the use of qCT images (maximal bronchodilation at total lung capacity [TLC], or inspiration, and functional residual capacity [FRC], or expiration) from the cluster phenotypes of SARP participants (cluster 1: minimal disease; cluster 2: mild, reversible; cluster 3: obese asthma; cluster 4: severe, reversible; cluster 5: severe, irreversible) enrolled between September 2001 and December 2015. Airway morphometry was performed along standard paths (RB1, RB4, RB10, LB1, and LB10). Corresponding voxels from TLC and FRC images were mapped with use of deformable image registration to characterize disease probability maps (DPMs) of functional small airway disease (fSAD), voxel-level volume changes (Jacobian), and isotropy (anisotropic deformation index [ADI]). The association between cluster assignment and qCT measures was evaluated using linear mixed models. Results A total of 455 participants were evaluated with cluster assignments and CT (mean age ± SD, 42.1 years ± 14.7; 270 women). Airway morphometry had limited ability to help discern between clusters. DPM fSAD was highest in cluster 5 (cluster 1 in SARP III: 19.0% ± 20.6; cluster 2: 18.9% ± 13.3; cluster 3: 24.9% ± 13.1; cluster 4: 24.1% ± 8.4; cluster 5: 38.8% ± 14.4; <i>P</i> < .001). Lower whole-lung Jacobian and ADI values were associated with greater cluster severity. Compared to cluster 1, cluster 5 lung expansion was 31% smaller (Jacobian in SARP III cohort: 2.31 ± 0.6 vs 1.61 ± 0.3, respectively, <i>P</i> < .001) and 34% more isotropic (ADI in SARP III cohort: 0.40 ± 0.1 vs 0.61 ± 0.2, <i>P</i> < .001). Within-lung Jacobian and ADI SDs decreased as severity worsened (Jacobian SD in SARP III cohort: 0.90 ± 0.4 for cluster 1; 0.79 ± 0.3 for cluster 2; 0.62 ± 0.2 for cluster 3; 0.63 ± 0.2 for cluster 4; and 0.41 ± 0.2 for cluster 5; <i>P</i> < .001).

Under oxygen-limiting conditions, mammalian cells generate L2HG to counteract the adverse effects of reductive stress induced by hypoxia. Very little is known, however, about whether and how L2HG provides tissue protection from redox stress during low-flow ischemia (LFI) and ischemia-reperfusion injury. We examined the cardioprotective effects of L2HG accumulation against LFI and ischemia-reperfusion injury and its underlying mechanism using genetic mouse models. L2HG accumulation was induced by homozygous (L2HGDH [L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase]<sup>-/-</sup>) or heterozygous (L2HGDH<sup>+/-</sup>) deletion of the <i>L2HGDH</i> gene in mice. Hearts isolated from these mice and their wild-type littermates (L2HGDH<sup>+/+</sup>) were subjected to baseline perfusion and 90-minute LFI or 30-minute no-flow ischemia followed by 60- or 120-minute reperfusion. Using [<sup>13</sup>C]- and [<sup>31</sup>P]-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, reverse transcription quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, triphenyltetrazolium staining, colorimetric/fluorometric spectroscopy, and echocardiography, we found that L2HGDH deletion induces L2HG accumulation at baseline and under stress conditions with significant functional consequences. In response to LFI or ischemia-reperfusion, L2HG accumulation shifts glucose flux from glycolysis towards the pentose phosphate pathway. These key metabolic changes were accompanied by enhanced cellular reducing potential, increased elimination of reactive oxygen species, attenuated oxidative injury and myocardial infarction, preserved cellular energy state, and improved cardiac function in both L2HGDH<sup>-/-</sup> and L2HGDH<sup>+/-</sup> hearts compared with L2HGDH<sup>+/+</sup> hearts under ischemic stress conditions. L2HGDH deletion-induced L2HG accumulation protects against myocardial injury during LFI and ischemia-reperfusion through a metabolic shift of glucose flux from glycolysis towards the pentose phosphate pathway. L2HG offers a novel mechanism for eliminating reactive oxygen species from myocardial tissue, mitigating redox stress, reducing myocardial infarct size, and preserving high-energy phosphates and cardiac function. Targeting L2HG levels through L2HGDH activity may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases related to oxidative injury.",Animals|Glucose|Glutarates|L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase|Mammals|Mice|Myocardial Infarction|Myocardial Reperfusion Injury|Oxidative Stress|Oxygen|Phosphates|Reactive Oxygen Species|glycolysis|ischemia|oxidative stress|pentose phosphate pathway|reactive oxygen species|reperfusion injury,"He, Huamei|Mulhern, Ryan M|Oldham, William M|Xiao, Wusheng|Lin, Yi-Dong|Liao, Ronglih|Loscalzo, Joseph",Circulation research,2022,2022-09-16,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

A CNN model was trained and validated over three replicates on a retrospective cohort of 4889 time-lapse embryo images. The algorithm processed embryo images for each patient and produced a unique identification key that was associated with the patient ID at a timepoint on day 3 (~ 65 hours post-insemination (hpi)) and day 5 (~ 105 hpi) forming our data library. When the algorithm evaluated embryos at a later timepoint on day 3 (~ 70 hpi) and day 5 (~ 110 hpi), it generates another key that was matched with the patient's unique key available in the library. This approach was tested using 400 patient embryo cohorts on day 3 and day 5 and number of correct embryo identifications with the CNN algorithm was measured. CNN technology matched the patient identification within random pools of 8 patient embryo cohorts on day 3 with 100% accuracy (n = 400 patients; 3 replicates). For day 5 embryo cohorts, the accuracy within random pools of 8 patients was 100% (n = 400 patients; 3 replicates).

The US FDA approved the first breath test for COVID-19 under emergency use authorization in April 2022. Most breath-based assays measure volatile metabolites exhaled by persons to identify a host response to infection. We hypothesized that the breathprint of COVID-19 fluctuated after Omicron became the primary variant of transmission over the Delta variant. We collected breath samples from 142 persons with and without a confirmed COVID-19 infection during the Delta and Omicron waves. Breath samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we show that based on 63 exhaled compounds, a general COVID-19 model had an accuracy of 0.73 ± 0.06, which improved to 0.82 ± 0.12 when modeling only the Delta wave, and 0.84 ± 0.06 for the Omicron wave. The specificity improved for the Delta and Omicron models (0.79 ± 0.21 and 0.74 ± 0.12, respectively) relative to the general model (0.61 ± 0.13). We report that the volatile signature of COVID-19 in breath differs between the Delta-predominant and Omicron-predominant variant waves, and accuracies improve when samples from these waves are modeled separately rather than as one universal approach.

In this mini-review, we discuss the noncanonical role of renal intercalated cells (ICs) in pathogen defense and in the initiation of sterile inflammation. This last function has strong implications in the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI), a potentially fatal medical complication that is seen in hospitalized patients. AKI is associated with inflammation, and it is often diagnosed only after the kidneys have suffered significant and often irreversible damage. While examining the regulation of proton secretion by type A ICs (A-ICs), we unexpectedly found high expression of the pro-inflammatory purinergic receptor P2Y14 in these cells. This receptor is located on the apical surface of A-ICs and binds UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), a danger-associated molecular pattern molecule released from injured cells that is filtered by the glomeruli and is concentrated in the collecting duct lumen. UDP-Glc activates P2Y14 in A-ICs and triggers the production of chemokines that attract pro-inflammatory immune cells into the kidney stroma and aggravate ischemia-induced proximal tubule injury. Inhibition of P2Y14 or deletion of its gene specifically in ICs in a murine model of ischemia-reperfusion injury attenuated these effects. Thus, together with their previously recognized role in pathogen defense, A-ICs are now recognized as sensors and mediators of renal sterile inflammation that participate in the onset of AKI. Blocking the UDP-Glc/P2Y14 pathway in A-ICs provides new insights into the development of novel AKI therapeutics.",Acute Kidney Injury|Animals|Epithelial Cells|Female|Humans|Immune cell infiltration|Inflammation|Innate immunity|Kidney|Male|Mice|Monocytes|Nephritis|Neutrophils|Reperfusion Injury|Sterile inflammation|Tubular injury|Uridine Diphosphate,"Breton, Sylvie|Battistone, Maria Agustina",Nephron,2022,2022-01-01,Journal Article|Review,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

For 30 years, the basic etiology of HCM has been attributed largely to variants in individual genes encoding cardiac sarcomere proteins, with the implication that HCM is fundamentally a genetic disease. However, data from clinical and network medicine analyses, as well as contemporary genetic studies show that single gene variants do not fully explain the broad and diverse HCM clinical spectrum. These transformative advances place a new focus on possible novel interactions between acquired disease determinants and genetic context to produce complex HCM phenotypes, also offering a measure of caution against overemphasizing monogenics as the principal cause of this disease. These new perspectives in which HCM is not a uniformly genetic disease but likely explained by multifactorial etiology will also unavoidably impact how HCM is viewed by patients and families in the clinical practicing community going forward, including relevance to genetic counseling and access to healthcare insurance and psychosocial wellness.","Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic|Heart|Humans|Mutation|Phenotype|Sarcomeres","Maron, Bradley A|Wang, Rui-Sheng|Carnethon, Mercedes R|Rowin, Ethan J|Loscalzo, Joseph|Maron, Barry J|Maron, Martin S",The American journal of cardiology,2022,2022-09-15,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

We show that peptides with specific repetitions of defined amino acids (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., arginine, histidine, or phenylalanine) can induce assembly and coalescence of the AgNPs (20 nm) into a hyperbranched structure (AgFSs) (∼2 μm). The dynamic process of this assembly was systematically investigated, and the extinction of the nanostructures can be modulated from 400 to 600 nm by varying the peptide sequences and molar ratio. According to this rationale, two strategies of SARS-CoV-2 detection were investigated. The activity of the main protease (Mpro) involved in SARS-CoV-2 was validated with a peptide substrate that can bridge the AgNPs after the proteolytic cleavage. A sub-nanomolar limit of detection (0.5 nM) and the capacity to distinguish by the naked eye in a wide concentration range (1.25-30 nM) were achieved. Next, a multichannel sensor-array based on multiplex peptides that can visually distinguish SARS-CoV-2 proteases from influenza proteases in doped human samples was investigated.",Biomarkers|COVID-19|Colorimetry|Fractals|Humans|Limit of Detection|Metal Nanoparticles|Peptide Hydrolases|Peptides|SARS-CoV-2|Silver|coalescence|colorimetric sensing|fractal structures|peptides|sensor-array silver nanomaterials,"Retout, Maurice|Mantri, Yash|Jin, Zhicheng|Zhou, Jiajing|Noël, Grégoire|Donovan, Brian|Yim, Wonjun|Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS nano,2022,2022-04-26,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DE031114,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

However, it is not straightforward to interpret the Brier score for a prediction model since its value depends on the outcome prevalence. We decompose the Brier score into two components, the mean squares between the estimated and true underlying binary probabilities, and the variance of the binary outcome that is not reflective of the model performance. We then propose to modify the Brier score by removing the variance of the binary outcome, estimated via a general sliding window approach. We show that the new proposed measure is more sensitive for comparing different models through simulation. A standardized performance improvement measure is also proposed based on the new criterion to quantify the improvement of prediction performance.

Inflammation resolution is an active series of biologic processes orchestrated by a family of bioactive specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from essential omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this review, we highlight recent findings on dysregulated inflammation resolution in common respiratory diseases and recent literature on SPM generation with PUFA dietary supplementation with relevance to diseases of respiratory inflammation. Human studies and preclinical models of diseases of lung inflammation have revealed disequilibrium in the levels of pro-inflammatory versus pro-resolving mediators. Recent studies identified actions for SPMs on regulating prophlogistic host responses and stimulating inflammation resolution pathways in inflammatory respiratory diseases. Dietary marine oils are enriched in PUFAs and contain parent omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and precursors for conversion to SPMs. Nutritional supplementation with fish oils can boost SPM levels and offer a therapeutic approach targeting inflammation resolution pathways for diseases of lung inflammation.","COVID-19|Fatty Acids, Omega-3|Fatty Acids, Omega-6|Fish Oils|Humans|Inflammation|SARS-CoV-2","Cagnina, R Elaine|Duvall, Melody G|Nijmeh, Julie|Levy, Bruce D",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2022,2022-03-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We deployed active air samplers to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real-world settings across communities in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Over 29 weeks, we collected 527 air samples from 15 congregate settings. We detected 106 samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in continuous air samples collected from a variety of real-world settings. We expanded the utility of air surveillance to test for 40 other respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data revealed differences in timing and location of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus detection. In addition, we obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from air samples to identify variant lineages. Collectively, this shows air sampling is a scalable, high throughput surveillance tool that could be used in conjunction with other methods for detecting respiratory pathogens in congregate settings.","COVID-19|Humans|Minnesota|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wisconsin","Ramuta, Mitchell D|Newman, Christina M|Brakefield, Savannah F|Stauss, Miranda R|Wiseman, Roger W|Kita-Yarbro, Amanda|O'Connor, Eli J|Dahal, Neeti|Lim, Ailam|Poulsen, Keith P|Safdar, Nasia|Marx, John A|Accola, Molly A|Rehrauer, William M|Zimmer, Julia A|Khubbar, Manjeet|Beversdorf, Lucas J|Boehm, Emma C|Castañeda, David|Rushford, Clayton|Gregory, Devon A|Yao, Joseph D|Bhattacharyya, Sanjib|Johnson, Marc C|Aliota, Matthew T|Friedrich, Thomas C|O'Connor, David H|O'Connor, Shelby L",Nature communications,2022,2022-08-11,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DA053893,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Among patients (median age 17.1 years) in whom antibody testing was performed (median 118 days post-vaccine completion), a SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG antibody was detected in 28 of 40 (70%) post-HTx recipients (median antibody level 10.9 AU/ml). Neutropenia, diabetes mellitus, and previous use of rituximab were associated with absence of a detectable antibody. All 7 post-HTx patients with a known pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 viral infection had a detectable SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG. All 12 vaccinated pre-HTx patients had a detectable antibody (median antibody level 11.6 AU/ml) including 5 patients that maintained detectable antibodies post-HTx. There were no cases of myocarditis among the total of 17 pre-HTx and 81 post-HTx patients that underwent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Without means of safe removal, these stronger adhesives are difficult to painlessly remove from the skin and may cause medical-adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to device dislodgement and further medical complications. This paper outlines the development of a high-adhesion medical tape designed for low skin trauma upon release. By warming the skin-attached tape for 10-30 s, a significant loss in adhesion was achieved. A C14/C18 copolymer was developed and combined with a selected pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) material. The addition of 1% C14/C18 copolymer yielded the largest temperature-responsive drop in surface adhesion. The adhesive film was characterized using AFM, and distinct nanodomains were identified on the exterior surface of the PSA. Our optimized formulation yielded 67% drop in adhesion when warmed to 45 °C, perhaps due to melting nanodomains weakening the adhesive-substrate boundary layer. Pilot clinical testing resulted in a significant decrease in pain when a heat pack was used for removal, giving an average pain reduction of 66%.",Adhesives|Humans|Pain|Quality of Health Care|Skin|Temperature|adhesive film|functional polymer|medical device|skin injury|temperature responsive,"Swanson, Shawn|Bashmail, Rahaf|Fellin, Christopher R|Luu, Vivian|Shires, Nicholas|Cox, Phillip A|Nelson, Alshakim|MacKenzie, Devin|Taroc, Ann-Marie|Nelson, Leonard Y|Seibel, Eric J",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,2022-06-28,Journal Article,HL152401,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, the newly emerged B.1.1.159 (Omicron) variant may evade vaccinal protection more easily than previous strains. It is of clinical interest to better understand the neutralizing activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants after booster vaccine or COVID-19 infection in these mostly immunocompromised patients. Hemodialysis patients from four dialysis centers were recruited between June 2021 and February 2022. Each patient provided a median of six serum samples. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against wild type (WT) or Omicron were measured using the GenScript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit. Forty-two patients had three doses of mRNA1273. Compared to levels prior to the third dose, nAb-WT increased 18-fold (peak at day 23) and nAb-Omicron increased 23-fold (peak at day 24) after the third dose. Peak nAb-WT exceeded peak nAb-Omicron 27-fold. Twenty-one patients had COVID-19 between December 24, 2021, and February 2, 2022. Following COVID-19, nAb-WT and nAb-Omicron increased 12- and 40-fold, respectively. While levels of vaccinal and post-COVID nAb-WT were comparable, post-COVID nAb-Omicron levels were 3.2 higher than the respective peak vaccinal nAb-Omicron. Four immunocompromised patients having reasons other than end-stage kidney disease have very low to no nAb after the third dose or COVID-19. Our results suggest that most hemodialysis patients have a strong humoral response to the third dose of vaccination and an even stronger post-COVID-19 humoral response.

The aim of saliva diagnostics is therefore to develop a rapid and noninvasive detection of oral and systemic diseases that could be used together with compact analysis systems in the clinic to facilitate point-of-care diagnostics.","Biomarkers, Tumor|Early Detection of Cancer|Humans|Liquid Biopsy|Neoplasms|Saliva|circulating biomarkers|saliva exosomics|saliva liquid biopsy|salivaomics|salivary exosomes","Nonaka, Taichiro|Wong, David T W","Annual review of analytical chemistry (Palo Alto, Calif.)",2022,2022-06-13,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Review",TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

To monitor New York City (NYC) for the presence of novel variants, we deep sequence most of the receptor binding domain coding sequence of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the New York City wastewater. Here we report detecting increasing frequencies of novel cryptic SARS-CoV-2 lineages not recognized in GISAID's EpiCoV database. These lineages contain mutations that had been rarely observed in clinical samples, including Q493K, Q498Y, E484A, and T572N and share many mutations with the Omicron variant of concern. Some of these mutations expand the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by allowing infection of cells expressing the human, mouse, or rat ACE2 receptor. Finally, pseudoviruses containing the spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were resistant to different classes of receptor binding domain neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We offer several hypotheses for the anomalous presence of these lineages, including the possibility that these lineages are derived from unsampled human COVID-19 infections or that they indicate the presence of a non-human animal reservoir.","Adult|Aged|Animals|Antibodies, Monoclonal|Antibodies, Neutralizing|Antibodies, Viral|COVID-19|Female|Genetic Variation|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Humans|Male|Mice|Middle Aged|Mutation|New York City|Protein Binding|Rats|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|Wastewater|Water Microbiology|Young Adult","Smyth, Davida S|Trujillo, Monica|Gregory, Devon A|Cheung, Kristen|Gao, Anna|Graham, Maddie|Guan, Yue|Guldenpfennig, Caitlyn|Hoxie, Irene|Kannoly, Sherin|Kubota, Nanami|Lyddon, Terri D|Markman, Michelle|Rushford, Clayton|San, Kaung Myat|Sompanya, Geena|Spagnolo, Fabrizio|Suarez, Reinier|Teixeiro, Emma|Daniels, Mark|Johnson, Marc C|Dennehy, John J",Nature communications,2022,2022-02-03,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053893,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Developing multitarget drugs could be a powerful strategy to impact the progressive loss of cognitive functions in this disease. The purpose of this study is to select a multitarget lead peptide candidate among a series of peptide variants derived from the neutrophil granule protein cathepsin G. We screened eight peptide candidates using the following criteria: (1) Inhibition and reversion of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) direct binding of peptide candidates to the human receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), quantified by ELISA; (3) protection against Aβ oligomer-induced neuronal cell death, using trypan blue to measure cell death in a murine neuronal cell line; (4) inhibition of TLR4 activation by S100A9, using a human TLR4 reporter cell line. We selected a 27-mer lead peptide that fulfilled these four criteria. This lead peptide is a privileged structure that displays inherent multitarget activity.

Our results underscore the importance of the polyproline module, which enables the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) to recognize the peptidic ligand on nanosurfaces for subsequent plasmonic coupling <i>via</i> Coulombic interactions. AuNP aggregation is favored by the lowered surface potential due to enzymatic unveiling of the zwitterionic module. Therefore, this system provides a naked-eye measure for M<sup>pro</sup>.

In particular, an association between metal exposure and CVDs has become evident but causal evidence still lacks. Therefore, this symposium at the Society of Toxicology 2022 annual meeting addressed epidemiological, clinical, pre-clinical animal model-derived and mechanism-based evidence by five presentations: 1) An epidemiologic study on potential CVD risks of individuals exposed occupationally and environmentally to heavy metals; 2) Both presentations of the second and third were clinical studies focusing on the potential link between heavy metals and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by presenting altered blood metal concentrations of both non-essential and essential metals in the patients with PAH and potential therapeutic approaches; 3) Arsenic-induced atherosclerosis via inflammatory cells in mouse model; 4) Pathogenic effects on the heart by adult chronic exposure to very low-dose cadmium via epigenetic mechanisms and whole life exposure to low dose cadmium via exacerbating high-fat-diet-lipotoxicity. This symposium has brought epidemiologists, therapeutic industry, physicians, and translational scientists together to discuss the health risks of occupational and environmental exposure to heavy metals through direct cardiotoxicity and indirect disruption of homeostatic mechanisms regulating essential metals, as well as lipid levels. The data summarized by the presenters infers a potential causal link between multiple metals and CVDs and defines differences and commonalities. Therefore, summary of these presentations may accelerate the development of efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies by facilitating collaborations among multidisciplinary investigators.","Animals|Arsenic|Cadmium|Cardiovascular Diseases|Cardiovascular diseases|Environmental Exposure|Epidemiological evidence|Lipids|Metal toxicities|Metals, Heavy|Mice|Pulmonary hypertension, arsenics, cadmium","Huang, Jiapeng|El-Kersh, Karim|Mann, Koren K|James, Katherine A|Cai, Lu",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2022,2022-11-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",TR003787,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

Prior research demonstrates that individuals with PAH belonging to socially disadvantaged groups experience worse clinical outcomes. Whether these poor outcomes are mediated by delays in care or other factors is incompletely understood. We sought to examine the association between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and time-to-PAH treatment. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Veterans diagnosed with incident PAH between 2006 and 2019 and treated with PAH therapy. Our outcome was time-to-PAH treatment. Our primary exposures were race/ethnicity, annual household income, health insurance status, education, and housing insecurity. We calculated time-to-treatment using multivariable mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard models. Of 1827 Veterans with PAH, 27% were Black, 4% were Hispanic, 22.1% had an income < $20,000, 53.3% lacked non-VA insurance, 25.5% had <high school education, and 3.9% had housing insecurity. Median time-to-treatment was 114 days (interquartile range [IQR] 21-336). Our multivariable models demonstrated increased time-to-treatment among patients with lower household income (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.91 for < $20,000 vs. ≥ $100,000) and those without non-VA insurance (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-1.00). Race/ethnicity, education, and housing insecurity were not associated with time-to-treatment. Veterans with PAH experienced substantial and potentially harmful treatment delays, with median time-to-treatment of 16 weeks after diagnosis. Those with lower income and those without non-VA health insurance experienced even greater treatment delays. Additional research is urgently needed to develop interventions to improve timely PAH treatment and mitigate economic disparities in treatment.","pulmonary arterial hypertension|racial, ethnic, or social disparities in lung disease and treatment|research design/program evaluation/statistical models","Gillmeyer, Kari R|Rinne, Seppo T|Qian, Shirley X|Maron, Bradley A|Johnson, Shelsey W|Klings, Elizabeth S|Wiener, Renda S",Pulmonary circulation,2022,2022-10-01,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

By extracting features interpretable by clinicians, we applied Gradient Boosted Decision Tree machine learning on a dataset of 2630 patients to build 240 models. Validation was performed on a geographically distinct dataset. Relative to onset, predictions were clocked as per 16 pairs of monitoring intervals and prediction times, and the outcomes were ranked. The combination of HR and Temp was found to be a minimal feature set yielding maximal predictability with area under receiver operating curve 0.94, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.90. Whereas HR and RR each directly enhance prediction, the effects of SpO<sub>2</sub> and Temp are significant only when combined with HR or RR. In benchmarking relative to standard methods Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and quick-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), Vital-SEP outperformed all 3 of them. It can be concluded that using intensive care unit data even 2 vital signs are adequate to predict sepsis upto 6 h in advance with promising accuracy comparable to standard scoring methods and other sepsis predictive tools reported in literature. Vital-SEP can be used for fast-track prediction especially in limited resource hospital settings where laboratory based hematologic or biochemical assays may be unavailable, inaccurate, or entail clinically inordinate delays.

In some cases, such as S-gene target failure, the impact can serve as a unique indicator of a particular SARS-CoV-2 variant and provide a method for rapid detection. Here, we describe partial ORF1ab gene target failure (pOGTF) on the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assays, defined by a ≥2-thermocycle delay in detection of the ORF1ab gene compared to that of the E-gene. We demonstrate that pOGTF is 98.6% sensitive and 99.9% specific for SARS-CoV-2 lineage BA.2.12.1, an emerging variant in the United States with spike L452Q and S704L mutations that may affect transmission, infectivity, and/or immune evasion. Increasing rates of pOGTF closely mirrored rates of BA.2.12.1 sequences uploaded to public databases, and, importantly, increasing local rates of pOGTF also mirrored increasing overall test positivity.

Traditional prediction models have poor performance at identifying patients at highest risk of unplanned healthcare utilization. Identification of patients who are high-need and high-cost (HNHC) could reduce unplanned healthcare utilization and healthcare costs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in adult patients hospitalized with IBD using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (model derivation in the 2013 Nationwide Readmission Database and validation in the 2017 Nationwide Readmission Database). We built 2 tree-based algorithms (decision tree classifier and decision tree using gradient boosting framework [XGBoost]) and compared traditional logistic regression to identify patients at risk for becoming HNHC (patients in the highest decile of total days spent in hospital in a calendar year). Of 47,402 adult patients hospitalized with IBD, we identified 4,717 HNHC patients. The decision tree classifier model (length of stay, Charlson Comorbidity Index, procedure, Frailty Risk Score, and age) had a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 ± 0.01 in the derivation data set and 0.78 ± 0.02 in the validation data set.

Although most pediatric patients present with mild disease, they are still at risk for developing significant morbidity requiring hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. This study was performed to evaluate if the presence of concurrent respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with an increased rate of ICU level of care.

Understanding neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 after vaccine breakthrough infections will provide insights into BA.2 infectivity and susceptibility to subsequent reinfection. Live virus neutralization assays were used to study immunity against Delta and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in samples from 86 individuals, 24 unvaccinated (27.9%) and 62 vaccinated (72.1%), who were infected with Delta (n = 42, 48.8%) or BA.1 (n = 44, 51.2%). Among the 62 vaccinated individuals, 39 were unboosted (62.9%), whereas 23 were boosted (37.1%). In unvaccinated infections, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the three variants were weak or undetectable, except against Delta for Delta-infected individuals. Both Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections resulted in strong nAb responses against ancestral wild-type and Delta lineages, but moderate nAb responses against BA.1 and BA.2, with similar titers between unboosted and boosted individuals. Antibody titers against BA.2 were generally higher than those against BA.1 in breakthrough infections. These results underscore the decreased immunogenicity of BA.1 compared to BA.2, insufficient neutralizing immunity against BA.2 in unvaccinated individuals, and moderate to strong neutralizing immunity induced against BA.2 in Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections.","Antibodies, Neutralizing|Antibodies, Viral|COVID-19|Humans|Omicron BA.1|Omicron BA.2|Vaccines|and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants|breakthrough infection|neutralizing antibodies|vaccine boosting","Brazer, Noah|Morris, Mary Kate|Servellita, Venice|Anglin, Khamal|Saldhi, Prachi|Garcia-Knight, Miguel|Bethancourt, Sutana|Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia|Wang, Baolin|Foresythe, Abiodun|Nguyen, Jenny|Gliwa, Amelia S|Pineda-Ramirez, Jesus|Sanchez, Ruth Diaz|Zhang, Yueyuan|Ott, Melanie|Wadford, Debra A|Andino, Raul|Kelly, J Daniel|Hanson, Carl|Chiu, Charles Y",The Journal of infectious diseases,2022,2022-11-11,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HD105618,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Such fingerprints can be useful for comparing microbial niches for environmental research, as well as for applications within forensic science and public health. To determine the regional specificity for environmental metagenomes, we examined 4305 shotgun-sequenced samples from the MetaSUB Consortium dataset-the most extensive public collection of urban microbiomes, spanning 60 different cities, 30 countries, and 6 continents. We were able to identify city-specific microbial fingerprints using supervised machine learning (SML) on the taxonomic classifications, and we also compared the performance of ten SML classifiers. We then further evaluated the five algorithms with the highest accuracy, with the city and continental accuracy ranging from 85-89% to 90-94%, respectively. Thereafter, we used these results to develop Cassandra, a random-forest-based classifier that identifies bioindicator species to aid in fingerprinting and can infer higher-order microbial interactions at each site. We further tested the Cassandra algorithm on the Tara Oceans dataset, the largest collection of marine-based microbial genomes, where it classified the oceanic sample locations with 83% accuracy. These results and code show the utility of SML methods and Cassandra to identify bioindicator species across both oceanic and urban environments, which can help guide ongoing efforts in biotracing, environmental monitoring, and microbial forensics (MF).",Cities|Metagenome|Metagenomics|Microbiota|Supervised Machine Learning|bioindicator species|metagenomics|microbial fingerprint|microbial forensics|supervised machine learning,"Bhattacharya, Chandrima|Tierney, Braden T|Ryon, Krista A|Bhattacharyya, Malay|Hastings, Jaden J A|Basu, Srijani|Bhattacharya, Bodhisatwa|Bagchi, Debneel|Mukherjee, Somsubhro|Wang, Lu|Henaff, Elizabeth M|Mason, Christopher E",Genes,2022,2022-10-21,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Since levels in wastewater are dependent upon human inputs, we hypothesize that tracking infections can be improved by normalizing wastewater concentrations against indicators of human waste [Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), β-2 Microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform]. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 and indicators of human waste in wastewater from two sewersheds of different scales: a University campus and a wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater data were combined with complementary COVID-19 case tracking to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater surveillance for forecasting new COVID-19 cases and, for the larger scale, hospitalizations. Results show that the normalization of SARS-CoV-2 levels by PMMoV and B2M resulted in improved correlations with COVID-19 cases for campus data using volcano second generation (V2G)-qPCR chemistry (<i>r</i> <sub>s</sub> = 0.69 without normalization, <i>r</i> <sub>s</sub> = 0.73 with normalization). Mixed results were obtained for normalization by PMMoV for samples collected at the community scale.

This study presents the feasibility of indocyanine green-assisted near-infrared fluorescence (ICG-NIRF) dental imaging with 785-nm NIR laser in the first (ICG-NIRF-I: 700 to 1000 nm) and second (ICG-NIRF-II: 1000 to 1700 nm) NIR wavelengths. Sprague Dawley rats with different postnatal days were used as animal models. ICG, as a fluorescence agent, was delivered to dental structures by subcutaneous injection (SC) and oral administration (OA). For SC method, erupted and unerupted molars could be observed from ICG-NIRF images at a short imaging time (<1  min). ICG-NIRF-II could achieve a better image contrast in unerupted molars at 24 h after ICG injection. The OA could serve as a non-invasive method for ICG delivery; it could also cause the glow-in-dark effect in unerupted molars. For erupted molars, OA can be considered as mouthwash and exhibits outstanding performance for delivery of ICG dye; erupted molar structures could be observed at a short imaging time (<1  min) and low ICG dose (0.05  mg  /  kg). Overall, ICG-NIRF with mouthwash could perform in-vivo dental imaging in two NIR wavelengths at a short time and low ICG dose.","Animals|Fluorescence|Indocyanine Green|Mouthwashes|Optical Imaging|Rats|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|X-Rays|indocyanine green|indocyanine green delivery|mouthwash|near-infrared fluorescence dental imaging|oral administration","Li, Zhongqiang|Li, Zheng|Zaid, Waleed|Osborn, Michelle L|Li, Yanping|Yao, Shaomian|Xu, Jian",Journal of biomedical optics,2022,2022-06-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

However, extracting and finding useful image features from CXRs demand a heavy workload for radiologists. The aim of this study was to design a novel multiple-inputs (MI) convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of COVID-19 and extraction of critical regions from CXRs. We also investigated the effect of the number of inputs on the performance of our new MI-CNN model. A total of 6205 CXR images (including 3021 COVID-19 CXRs and 3184 normal CXRs) were used to test our MI-CNN models. CXRs could be evenly segmented into different numbers (2, 4, and 16) of individual regions. Each region could individually serve as one of the MI-CNN inputs. The CNN features of these MI-CNN inputs would then be fused for COVID-19 classification. More importantly, the contributions of each CXR region could be evaluated through assessing the number of images that were accurately classified by their corresponding regions in the testing data sets. In both the whole-image and left- and right-lung region of interest (LR-ROI) data sets, MI-CNNs demonstrated good efficiency for COVID-19 classification. In particular, MI-CNNs with more inputs (2-, 4-, and 16-input MI-CNNs) had better efficiency in recognizing COVID-19 CXRs than the 1-input CNN. Compared to the whole-image data sets, the efficiency of LR-ROI data sets showed approximately 4% lower accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision (over 91%). In considering the contributions of each region, one of the possible reasons for this reduced performance was that nonlung regions (eg, region 16) provided false-positive contributions to COVID-19 classification. The MI-CNN with the LR-ROI data set could provide a more accurate evaluation of the contribution of each region and COVID-19 classification. Additionally, the right-lung regions had higher contributions to the classification of COVID-19 CXRs, whereas the left-lung regions had higher contributions to identifying normal CXRs. Overall, MI-CNNs could achieve higher accuracy with an increasing number of inputs (eg, 16-input MI-CNN).

However, Vβ21.3 CD8+ T cells that responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides were detected in only a single subject, suggesting recognition of nonviral antigens in the majority of subjects. Subjects studied 6-14 months after MIS-C showed T cell epitope spreading, meaning the activation of T cells that recognize more SARS-CoV-2 peptides following the initial expansion of T cells that see immunodominant epitopes. For example, subjects that did not recognize nonspike proteins in the subacute phase of MIS-C showed good Th response to nonspike peptides, and/or CD8+ T cell responses not appreciable before arose over time and could be detected in the 6-14 months' follow-up. The magnitude of the Th and CTL responses also increased over time. In summary, patients with MIS-C associated with acute lymphopenia, a classical feature of MIS-C, showed a physiological response to the virus with a prominent role for virus-specific DN T cells.",CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes|CD4− CD8− double-negative T cells|CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes|COVID-19|Child|Humans|MIS-C|Peptides|SARS-CoV-2|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|T cell receptor Vβ21.3|T cells,"Hsieh, Li-En|Song, Jaeyoon|Grifoni, Alba|Shimizu, Chisato|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Dummer, Kirsten B|Burns, Jane C|Sette, Alessandro|Franco, Alessandra",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,2022-06-29,Journal Article,HD105590,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

To address these challenges, we combine transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues to define body-wide transcriptome changes in response to COVID-19. We then match these data with spatial protein and expression profiling across 357 tissue sections from 16 representative patient lung samples and identify tissue-compartment-specific damage wrought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, evident as a function of varying viral loads during the clinical course of infection and tissue-type-specific expression states. Overall, our findings reveal a systemic disruption of canonical cellular and transcriptional pathways across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19 and to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.","Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Cohort Studies|Female|Gene Expression Regulation|Humans|Influenza, Human|Lung|Male|Middle Aged|NGS|Orthomyxoviridae|RNA-Seq|RNA-seq|Respiratory Distress Syndrome|SARS-CoV-2|Transcriptome|Viral Load|coronavirus|coronavirus disease 2019|evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|host response|next-generation sequencing|spatial transcriptomics","Park, Jiwoon|Foox, Jonathan|Hether, Tyler|Danko, David C|Warren, Sarah|Kim, Youngmi|Reeves, Jason|Butler, Daniel J|Mozsary, Christopher|Rosiene, Joel|Shaiber, Alon|Afshin, Evan E|MacKay, Matthew|Rendeiro, André F|Bram, Yaron|Chandar, Vasuretha|Geiger, Heather|Craney, Arryn|Velu, Priya|Melnick, Ari M|Hajirasouliha, Iman|Beheshti, Afshin|Taylor, Deanne|Saravia-Butler, Amanda|Singh, Urminder|Wurtele, Eve Syrkin|Schisler, Jonathan|Fennessey, Samantha|Corvelo, André|Zody, Michael C|Germer, Soren|Salvatore, Steven|Levy, Shawn|Wu, Shixiu|Tatonetti, Nicholas P|Shapira, Sagi|Salvatore, Mirella|Westblade, Lars F|Cushing, Melissa|Rennert, Hanna|Kriegel, Alison J|Elemento, Olivier|Imielinski, Marcin|Rice, Charles M|Borczuk, Alain C|Meydan, Cem|Schwartz, Robert E|Mason, Christopher E",Cell reports.

Organoids are human, experimentally accessible, high throughput, and enable reconstitution of tissue-scale biology in a petri dish. Although gene expression patterns in organoid cells have been analyzed extensively, less is known about the functionality of these structures. Here, we review assays of physiological function in human kidney organoids, including best practices for quality control, and future applications. Tubular structures in organoids accumulate specific molecules through active transport, including dextran and organic anions, and swell with fluid in response to cAMP stimulation. When engrafted into animal models in vivo, organoids form vascularized glomerulus-like structures capable of size-selective filtration. Organoids exhibit metabolic, endocrine, injury, and infection phenotypes, although their specificity is not yet fully clear. To properly interpret organoid physiology assays, it is important to incorporate appropriate negative and positive controls, statistical methods, data presentation, molecular mechanisms, and clinical data sets. Improvements in organoid perfusion, patterning, and maturation are needed to enable branching morphogenesis, urine production, and renal replacement.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted <i>in vivo</i> studies to validate DEspR+ neutrophil-subset as therapeutic target and test efficacy of DEspR-inhibition in acute neutrophilic hyperinflammation models. We performed tests in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute neutrophilic inflammation in three species - human, rhesus macaque, rat - with increasing dose-dependent severity. We measured DEspR+CD66b+ neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in healthy volunteers (HVs) 24-hours after segmental LPS-challenge by ChipCytometry, and DEspR+CD11b+ neutrophils in whole blood and BALF in an LPS-induced transient acute lung injury (ALI) model in macaques. We determined anti-DEspR antibody efficacy <i>in vivo</i> in LPS-ALI macaque model and in high-mortality LPS-induced encephalopathy in hypertensive rats. ChipCytometry detected increased BALF total neutrophil and DEspR+CD66b+ neutrophil counts after segmental LPS-challenge compared to baseline (<i>P</i> =0.034), as well as increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to pre-LPS level (<i>P <</i>0.05). In the LPS-ALI macaque model, flow cytometry detected increased DEspR+ and DEspR[-] neutrophils in BALF, which was associated with moderate-severe hypoxemia. After determining pharmacokinetics of single-dose anti-DEspR[hu6g8] antibody, one-time pre-LPS anti-DEspR treatment reduced hypoxemia (<i>P</i> =0.03) and neutrophil influx into BALF <i>(P</i> =0.0001) in LPS-ALI <i>vs</i> vehicle mock-treated LPS-ALI macaques. <i>Ex vivo</i> live cell imaging of macaque neutrophils detected greater ""intrinsic adhesion to hard-surface"" in DEspR+ <i>vs</i> DEspR[-] neutrophils (<i>P <</i>0.001).

Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater is critical for interpreting the viral loads, comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds, and identifying the vulnerable communities. In this study, five population biomarkers, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), creatinine (CRE), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), caffeine (CAF) and its metabolite paraxanthine (PARA) were investigated and validated for their utility in normalizing the SARS-CoV-2 loads through two normalizing approaches using the data from 64 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Missouri. Their utility in assessing the real-time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated. The best performing candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized SARS-CoV-2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the City of Columbia, Missouri, a university town with a constantly fluctuating population. Our results showed that, except CRE, the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population of the given WWTP. Among selected biomarkers, PARA is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the SARS-CoV-2 load per capita due to its high accuracy, low variability, and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater. It also demonstrated its excellent utility for real-time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater. In addition, the viral loads normalized by the PARA-estimated population significantly improved the correlation (rho=0.5878, p < 0.05) between SARS-CoV-2 load per capita and case numbers per capita. This chemical biomarker complements the current normalization scheme recommended by CDC and helps us understand the size, distribution, and dynamics of local populations for forecasting the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 within each sewershed.","Biomarkers|COVID-19|Caffeine|Creatinine|Humans|Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid|Paraxanthine|Population biomarker|Population normalization|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring|Wastewater-based epidemiology","Hsu, Shu-Yu|Bayati, Mohamed|Li, Chenhui|Hsieh, Hsin-Yeh|Belenchia, Anthony|Klutts, Jessica|Zemmer, Sally A|Reynolds, Melissa|Semkiw, Elizabeth|Johnson, Hwei-Yiing|Foley, Trevor|Wieberg, Chris G|Wenzel, Jeff|Johnson, Marc C|Lin, Chung-Ho",Water research,2022,2022-09-01,Journal Article,DA053893,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Here, we report on novel findings linking endothelial expression of CD70 (also known as CD27 ligand) with alterations in NO and reactive oxygen species. CD70 expression was genetically manipulated in human aortic and pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Intracellular NO and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were measured using genetically encoded biosensors, and cellular phenotypes were assessed. An unbiased phenome-wide association study demonstrated that polymorphisms in CD70 associate with vascular phenotypes. Endothelial cells treated with CD70-directed short-interfering RNA demonstrated impaired wound closure, decreased agonist-stimulated NO levels, and reduced eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) protein. These changes were accompanied by reduced NO bioactivity, increased 3-nitrotyrosine levels, and a decrease in the eNOS binding partner heat shock protein 90. Following treatment with the thioredoxin inhibitor auranofin or with agonist histamine, intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels increased up to 80% in the cytosol, plasmalemmal caveolae, and mitochondria. There was increased expression of NADPH oxidase 1 complex and gp91phox; expression of copper/zinc and manganese superoxide dismutases was also elevated. CD70 knockdown reduced levels of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenger catalase; by contrast, glutathione peroxidase 1 expression and activity were increased. CD70 overexpression enhanced endothelial wound closure, increased NO levels, and attenuated the reduction in eNOS mRNA induced by TNFα. Taken together, these data establish CD70 as a novel regulatory protein in endothelial NO and reactive oxygen species homeostasis, with implications for human vascular disease.","CD27 Ligand|CD27 ligand|Endothelial Cells|Endothelium, Vascular|Humans|Hydrogen Peroxide|Nitric Oxide|Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III|Oxidation-Reduction|Oxidative Stress|Reactive Oxygen Species|endothelial dysfunction|homeostasis|nitric oxide synthase type III|reactive oxygen species","Pandey, Arvind K|Waldeck-Weiermair, Markus|Wells, Quinn S|Xiao, Wusheng|Yadav, Shambhu|Eroglu, Emrah|Michel, Thomas|Loscalzo, Joseph","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2022,2022-09-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We describe a single-center experience of hospitalized patients who received CCP for acute COVID-19. A retrospective review of children 0-18-years-old and pregnant patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed acute COVID-19 who received CCP from March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 was performed. Clinical and laboratory data were collected to assess the safety of CCP administration. Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in the CCP products and in patients before transfusion and at various time points post-transfusion. Correlation between the administered SARS-CoV-2 administered versus the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike immunoglobulin response in patient serum was assessed. Twenty-two children and ten obstetric patients were eligible. Twelve pediatric and eight obstetric patients had moderate disease and ten pediatric and two obstetric patients had severe disease. Five pediatric patients died. Eighteen of 37 (48.6%) CCP titers that were measured met US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for high immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer. There were no complications with transfusion. High-titer CCP showed a positive correlation with rise in patient total immunoglobulin levels only in obstetric patients but not in pediatric patients. Among pediatric patients, the median serum antibody level increased over time after transfusion. Coronavirus 2019 convalescent plasma was administered safely to our patients. Our study suggested that CCP did not interfere with endogenous antibody production. The antibody titer of CCP correlated with post-transfusion response only in obstetric patients. Randomized trials in pediatric and obstetric patients are needed to further understand how to dose CCP and evaluate efficacy.","Adolescent|Antibodies, Viral|COVID-19|COVID-19 Serotherapy|COVID-19 serotherapy|Child|Child, Preschool|Humans|Immunization, Passive|Immunoglobulin G|Infant|Infant, Newborn|SARS-CoV-2|child|pregnancy","Ikeda, Saki|Benzi, Eduardo|Hensch, Lisa A|Devaraj, Sridevi|Hui, Shiu-Ki Rocky|Gandhi, Manisha|Fox, Karin A|Teruya, Jun|Munoz, Flor M",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2022,2022-01-01,Journal Article,HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Existing studies mainly built models on datasets with limited geographical range or size. In this study, we developed COVID-19 mortality prediction models on worldwide, large-scale ""sparse"" data and on a ""dense"" subset of the data. We evaluated 6 classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost (AB), and Naive Bayes (NB). We also conducted temporal analysis and calibrated our models using Isotonic Regression. The results showed that AB outperformed the other classifiers for the sparse dataset, while LR provided the highest-performing results for the dense dataset (with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or AUC ≈ 0.7 for the sparse dataset and AUC = 0.963 for the dense one). We also identified impactful features such as symptoms, countries, age, and the date of death/discharge. All our models are well-calibrated (<i>P</i> > .1). Our results highlight the tradeoff of using sparse training data to increase generalizability versus training on denser data, which produces higher discrimination results. We found that covariates such as patient information on symptoms, countries (where the case was reported), age, and the date of discharge from the hospital or death were the most important for mortality prediction.

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitutions. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from long-term patient infections or animal reservoirs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity is greater than what is commonly observed through routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

Such an approach requires understanding how differences in experimental design affect miRNA expression. Variations in technical methodologies, coupled with inter-individual variability may reduce study reproducibility and generalizability. Another barrier facing salivary miRNA biomarker research is a lack of recognized ""control miRNAs"". In one of the largest studies of human salivary miRNA to date (922 healthy individuals), we utilized 1225 saliva samples to quantify variability in miRNA expression resulting from aligner selection (Bowtie1 vs. Bowtie2), saliva collection method (expectorated vs. swabbed), RNA stabilizer (presence vs. absence), and individual biological factors (sex, age, body mass index, exercise, caloric intake). Differential expression analyses revealed that absence of RNA stabilizer introduced the greatest variability, followed by differences in methods of collection and aligner. Biological factors generally affected a smaller number of miRNAs. We also reported coefficients of variations for 643 miRNAs consistently present in saliva, highlighting several salivary miRNAs to serve as reference genes. Thus, the results of this analysis can be used by researchers to optimize parameters of salivary miRNA measurement, exclude miRNAs confounded by numerous biologic factors, and identify appropriate miRNA controls.",Biomarkers|Humans|MicroRNAs|Reproducibility of Results|Saliva|biomarker|housekeeping|miRNA|salivary|stabilizer,"Sullivan, Rhea|Montgomery, Austin|Scipioni, Anna|Jhaveri, Pooja|Schmidt, Adam T|Hicks, Steven D",Genes,2022,2022-10-16,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105610,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Thus, there is an urgent need for new approaches to improve CVD drug treatments. As the development time and cost of drug discovery to clinical application are excessive, alternate strategies for drug development are warranted. Among these are included computational approaches based on omics data for drug repositioning, which have attracted increasing attention. In this work, we developed an adjusted similarity measure implemented by the algorithm SAveRUNNER to reposition drugs for cardiovascular diseases while, at the same time, considering the side effects of drug candidates. We analyzed nine cardiovascular disorders and two side effects. We formulated both disease disorders and side effects as network modules in the human interactome, and considered those drug candidates that are proximal to disease modules but far from side-effects modules as ideal. Our method provides a list of drug candidates for cardiovascular diseases that are unlikely to produce common, adverse side-effects.

This secondary tissue injury arises from dysregulated neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) intended to kill pathogens, but instead cause cell-injury. Insufficiency of pleiotropic therapeutic approaches delineate the need for inhibitors of dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) that induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown. We hypothesized that neutrophils expressing the pro-survival dual endothelin-1/VEGF-signal peptide receptor, DEspR, are apoptosis-resistant like DEspR+ cancer-cells, hence comprise a consequential pathogenic neutrophil-subset in ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS. Here, we report the significant association of increased peripheral DEspR+CD11b+ neutrophil-counts with severity and mortality in ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS, and intravascular NET-formation, in contrast to DEspR[-] neutrophils.

Human kidney organoids can reconstitute PKD cystogenesis in a genetically specific way, but the mechanisms underlying cystogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that subjecting organoids to fluid shear stress in a PKD-on-a-chip microphysiological system promotes cyst expansion via an absorptive rather than a secretory pathway. A diffusive static condition partially substitutes for fluid flow, implicating volume and solute concentration as key mediators of this effect. Surprisingly, cyst-lining epithelia in organoids polarize outwards towards the media, arguing against a secretory mechanism. Rather, cyst formation is driven by glucose transport into lumens of outwards-facing epithelia, which can be blocked pharmacologically. In PKD mice, glucose is imported through cysts into the renal interstitium, which detaches from tubules to license expansion. Thus, absorption can mediate PKD cyst growth in human organoids, with implications for disease mechanism and potential for therapy development.",Animals|Cysts|Epithelium|Humans|Kidney|Mice|Organoids|Polycystic Kidney Diseases,"Li, Sienna R|Gulieva, Ramila E|Helms, Louisa|Cruz, Nelly M|Vincent, Thomas|Fu, Hongxia|Himmelfarb, Jonathan|Freedman, Benjamin S",Nature communications,2022,2022-12-23,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL152401,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The key for improving the survival rate lies in reliable screening and early diagnosis. Existing techniques including barium-meal gastric photofluorography and upper endoscopy can be costly and time-consuming and are thus impractical for population screening. We look instead for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, currently also referred as exosomes) sized ⌀ 30-150 nm as a candidate. sEVs have attracted a significantly higher level of attention during the past decade or two because of their potentials in disease diagnoses and therapeutics. Here, we report that the composition information of the collective Raman-active bonds inside sEVs of human donors obtained by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) holds the potential for non-invasive GC detection. SERS was triggered by the substrate of gold nanopyramid arrays we developed previously. A machine learning-based spectral feature analysis algorithm was developed for objectively distinguishing the cancer-derived sEVs from those of the non-cancer sub-population. sEVs from the tissue, blood, and saliva of GC patients and non-GC participants were collected (<i>n</i> = 15 each) and analyzed. The algorithm prediction accuracies were reportedly 90, 85, and 72%. ""Leave-a-pair-of-samples out"" validation was further performed to test the clinical potential. The area under the curve of each receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96, 0.91, and 0.65 in tissue, blood, and saliva, respectively.

Currently, there are interesting opportunities for expanding the use of BLI in other fields, including the development of rapid diagnostic tools. To date, there are no detailed frameworks for implementing BLI in target-recognition studies that are pivotal for developing point-of-need biosensors. Here, we attempt to bridge these domains by providing a framework that connects output(s) of molecular interaction studies with key performance indicators used in the development of point-of-need biosensors. First, we briefly review the governing theory for protein-ligand interactions, and we then summarize the approach for real-time kinetic quantification using various techniques. The 2020 PRISMA guideline was used for all governing theory reviews and meta-analyses. Using the information from the meta-analysis, we introduce an experimental framework for connecting outcomes from BLI experiments (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>on</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) with electrochemical (capacitive) biosensor design. As a first step in the development of a larger framework, we specifically focus on mapping BLI outcomes to five biosensor key performance indicators (sensitivity, selectivity, response time, hysteresis, operating range). The applicability of our framework was demonstrated in a study of case based on published literature related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to show the development of a capacitive biosensor based on truncated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor. The case study focuses on non-specific binding and selectivity as research goals.

However, current methods of sEV separation require specialized equipment and time-consuming protocols and have difficulties producing highly pure subpopulations of sEVs. Here, we present Acoustic Nanoscale Separation via Wave-pillar Excitation Resonance (ANSWER), which allows single-step, rapid (<10 min), high-purity (>96% small exosomes, >80% exomeres) fractionation of sEV subpopulations from biofluids without the need for any sample preprocessing. Particles are iteratively deflected in a size-selective manner via an excitation resonance. This previously unidentified phenomenon generates patterns of virtual, tunable, pillar-like acoustic field in a fluid using surface acoustic waves. Highly precise sEV fractionation without the need for sample preprocessing or complex nanofabrication methods has been demonstrated using ANSWER, showing potential as a powerful tool that will enable more in-depth studies into the complexity, heterogeneity, and functionality of sEV subpopulations.",,"Zhang, Jinxin|Chen, Chuyi|Becker, Ryan|Rufo, Joseph|Yang, Shujie|Mai, John|Zhang, Peiran|Gu, Yuyang|Wang, Zeyu|Ma, Zhehan|Xia, Jianping|Hao, Nanjing|Tian, Zhenhua|Wong, David T W|Sadovsky, Yoel|Lee, Luke P|Huang, Tony Jun",Science advances,2022,2022-11-25,Journal Article,TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Although COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, there remains a need for rapid testing to limit viral spread from infected individuals. We previously identified the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) binding DNA aptamer 1 (SNAP1) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by aptamer-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and lateral flow assay (LFA). In this work, we identify a new aptamer that also binds at the NTD, named SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTD-binding DNA aptamer 4 (SNAP4). SNAP4 binds with high affinity (<30 nM) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a 2-fold improvement over SNAP1. Furthermore, we utilized both SNAP1 and SNAP4 in an aptamer sandwich LFA (AptaFlow), which detected SARS-CoV-2 UV-inactivated virus at concentrations as low as 10<sup>6</sup> copies/mL. AptaFlow costs <$1 per test to produce, provides results in <1 h, and detects SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations that indicate higher viral loads and a high probability of contagious transmission. AptaFlow is a potential approach for a low-cost, convenient antigen test to aid the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Antibodies, Viral|Aptamers, Nucleotide|COVID-19|COVID-19 Vaccines|Humans|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","Yang, Lucy F|Kacherovsky, Nataly|Panpradist, Nuttada|Wan, Ruixuan|Liang, Joey|Zhang, Bo|Salipante, Stephen J|Lutz, Barry R|Pun, Suzie H",Analytical chemistry,2022,2022-05-24,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",AA029316,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

However, the frequency and impact of CFTR variation among individuals with asthma is unknown. To determine whether potentially pathogenic CFTR variants associate with disease severity and whether individuals with two potentially pathogenic variants exist in a severe asthma-enriched cohort. We analyzed sequencing data spanning a 190.5Kb region of CFTR in participants from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP1-3). Potentially pathogenic, rare CFTR variants (frequency < 0.05) were classified as CF-causing or of varying clinical consequences (VVCC) (CFTR2. org). Regression-based models tested for association between CFTR genotypes (0-2 potentially pathogenic variants) and severity outcomes. Of 1401 participants, 9.5% (134) had one potentially pathogenic variant, occurring more frequently in non-Hispanic white (NHW, 10.1% [84 of 831]) compared to African American individuals (AA, 5.2% [22 of 426]). We found ≥2 potentially pathogenic CFTR variants in 1.4% (19); 0.5% (4) of NHW and 2.8% (12) of AA. Potentially pathogenic CFTR variant genotypes (≥1 or ≥2 variants) were not cumulatively associated with lung function or exacerbations. In NHW, we found three F508del compound heterozygotes with F508del and a VVCC (two 5 T; TG12[c.1210-11 T > G] and one Arg1070Trp) and a homozygote for the VVCC, 5 T; TG12. We found potentially pathogenic CFTR variants within a severe asthma-enriched cohort, including three compound heterozygote genotypes variably associated with CF in NHW individuals. These findings provide the rationale for CFTR sequencing and phenotyping of CF-related traits in individuals with severe asthma.","Asthma|CF-Asthma Overlap|CFTR|Cystic Fibrosis|Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator|Humans|Mutation|Sequence Analysis, DNA|cystic fibrosis|heterozygote carriers","Izquierdo, Manuel E|Marion, Chad R|Moore, Wendy C|Raraigh, Karen S|Taylor-Cousar, Jennifer L|Cutting, Gary R|Ampleford, E|Hawkins, Gregory A|Zein, Joe|Castro, M|Denlinger, Loren C|Erzurum, Serpil C|Fahy, John V|Israel, Elliot|Jarjour, Nizar N|Mauger, David|Levy, Bruce D|Wenzel, Sally E|Woodruff, Prescott|Bleecker, Eugene R|Meyers, Deborah A|Ortega, Victor E",Pediatric pulmonology,2022,2022-07-01,"Letter|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We used a retrospective case control study design to examine children ≤21 years hospitalized at a single, tertiary care children's hospital between March 2020 and June 2021. Our study population included children diagnosed with MIS-C (n = 111) and a control group of children hospitalized for MIS-C evaluation who had an alternative diagnosis (n = 61). Census tract COI was the exposure variable, determined using the patient's home address mapped to the census tract. Our outcome measure was MIS-C diagnosis. Odds ratios measured associations between COI and MIS-C diagnosis. Our study population included 111 children diagnosed with MIS-C and 61 children evaluated but ruled out for MIS-C. The distribution of census tract overall COI differed significantly between children diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children with an alternate diagnosis (P = .03). Children residing in census tracts with very low to low overall COI (2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-6.17) and very low to low health/environment COI (4.69, 95% CI 2.21-9.97) had significantly higher odds of being diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children living in moderate and high to very high COI census tracts, respectively.

Despite its prevalence and severity, early diagnosis of AD remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an integrated acoustofluidics-based diagnostic system (ADx), which combines triple functions of acoustics, microfluidics, and orthogonal biosensors for clinically accurate, sensitive, and rapid detection of AD biomarkers from human plasma. We design and fabricate a surface acoustic wave-based acoustofluidic separation device to isolate and purify AD biomarkers to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Multimodal biosensors within the integrated ADx are fabricated by in-situ patterning of the ZnO nanorod array and deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorods for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemical immunosensors. We obtain the label-free detections of SERS and electrochemical immunoassay of clinical plasma samples from AD patients and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. We believe that this efficient integration provides promising solutions for the early diagnosis of AD.","Acoustofluidics|Aged|Alzheimer Disease|Alzheimer's disease|Biosensing Techniques|Biosensor|Electrochemical|Humans|Immunoassay|Metal Nanoparticles|SERS|Silver|Spectrum Analysis, Raman","Hao, Nanjing|Wang, Zeyu|Liu, Pengzhan|Becker, Ryan|Yang, Shujie|Yang, Kaichun|Pei, Zhichao|Zhang, Peiran|Xia, Jianping|Shen, Liang|Wang, Lin|Welsh-Bohmer, Kathleen A|Sanders, Laurie|Lee, Luke P|Huang, Tony Jun",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2022,2022-01-15,Journal Article,TR003778,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

We evaluated the association between obesity and risk of hospitalization, surgery, or serious infections in patients with IBD in new users of biologic agents in a large, multicenter, electronic health record (EHR)-based cohort (CA-IBD). We created an EHR-based cohort of adult patients with IBD who were new users of biologic agents (tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α] antagonists, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab) between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2017, from 5 health systems in California. Patients were classified as those with normal body mass index (BMI), overweight, or obese based on the World Health Organization classification. We compared the risk of all-cause hospitalization, IBD-related surgery, or serious infections among patients with obesity vs those overweight vs those with normal BMI, using Cox proportional hazard analyses, adjusting for baseline demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics. Of 3,038 biologic-treated patients with IBD (69% with Crohn's disease and 76% on TNF-α antagonists), 28.2% (n = 858) were overweight, and 13.7% (n = 416) were obese. On a follow-up after biologic initiation, obesity was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] vs normal BMI, 0.90; [95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.13]); IBD-related surgery (aHR, 0.62 [0.31-1.22]); or serious infection (aHR, 1.11 [0.73-1.71]). Similar results were observed on stratified analysis by disease phenotype (Crohn's disease vs ulcerative colitis) and index biologic therapy (TNF-α antagonists vs non-TNF-α antagonists). In a multicenter, EHR-based cohort of biologic-treated patients with IBD, obesity was not associated with hospitalization, surgery, or serious infections.

Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgamma<sup>null</sup> (NSG) background. In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model. In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states. Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice. hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice. The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.",Accessory receptor|BSG|Basigin|CD147|COVID-19|Immune responses|Knock-in mouse model|NSG|Physiological expression|SARS-CoV-2|Spike protein|Viral entry|hCD147KI,"Badeti, Saiaditya|Jiang, Qingkui|Naghizadeh, Alireza|Tseng, Hsiang-Chi|Bushkin, Yuri|Marras, Salvatore A E|Nisa, Annuurun|Tyagi, Sanjay|Chen, Fei|Romanienko, Peter|Yehia, Ghassan|Evans, Deborah|Lopez-Gonzalez, Moises|Alland, David|Russo, Riccardo|Gause, William|Shi, Lanbo|Liu, Dongfang",Cell & bioscience,2022,2022-06-11,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Several scanning microscopes have been developed to resolve the inverse relationship between the resolution and field of view; however, those scanning microscopes still rely upon fluorescence labeling and complex optical systems. To overcome these limitations, we developed a dual-camera acoustofluidic nanoscope with a seamless image merging algorithm (alpha-blending process). This design allows us to precisely image both the sample and the microspheres simultaneously and accurately track the particle path and location. Therefore, the number of images required to capture the entire field of view (200 × 200 μm) by using our acoustofluidic scanning nanoscope is reduced by 55-fold compared with previous designs. Moreover, the image quality is also greatly improved by applying an alpha-blending imaging technique, which is critical for accurately depicting and identifying nanoscale objects or processes.

Wastewater analysis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA requires specialized equipment, expensive consumables, and expert staff, limiting its feasibility and scalability. Further, the extremely labile nature of viral RNA complicates sample transportation, especially in regions with limited access to reliable cold chains. Here, we present a new method for wastewater analysis, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), that substantially simplifies workflow (at least 70% decrease in time; 40% decrease in consumable usage compared with traditional techniques) by targeting the labor-intensive processing steps of RNA purification and concentration. To optimize and validate this method, we analyzed wastewater samples from residence halls at the University of Kentucky, of which 34% (44/129) contained detectible SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Although concurrent clinical testing was not comprehensive, student infections were identified in the 7 days following a positive wastewater detection in 68% of samples.

Here we compare the two syndromes using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e., the viral pandemic (ViP) and severe-ViP signatures and a 13-transcript signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD, and validated our findings in whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues. Results show that KD and MIS-C are on the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19. Both the pediatric syndromes converge upon an IL15/IL15RA-centric cytokine storm, suggestive of shared proximal pathways of immunopathogenesis; however, they diverge in other laboratory parameters and cardiac phenotypes. The ViP signatures reveal unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity.",Artificial Intelligence|COVID-19|Child|Computational Biology|Cytokines|Gene Expression Profiling|Humans|Immunity|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome,"Ghosh, Pradipta|Katkar, Gajanan D|Shimizu, Chisato|Kim, Jihoon|Khandelwal, Soni|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Kanegaye, John T||Bocchini, Joseph|Das, Soumita|Burns, Jane C|Sahoo, Debashis",Nature communications,2022,2022-05-16,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105590,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

The AuNPs were first aggregated by attractive forces between the citrate-capped surface and the arginine side chains. We found that the HS-PEG thiol group has a higher affinity for the AuNP surface, thus leading to redispersion and colloidal stability. In turn, there was a robust and obvious color change due to on/off plasmonic coupling. The assemblies' dissociation was directly related to the HS-PEG structural properties such as their size or charge. As an example, HS-PEGs with a molecular weight below 1 kDa could dissociate 100% of the assemblies and restore the exact optical properties of the initial AuNP suspension (prior to the assembly). Surprisingly, the dissociation capacity of HS-PEGs was not affected by the composition of the operating medium and could be performed in complex matrices such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell lysates, or even seawater. The high affinity of thiols for the gold surface encompasses by far the one of endogenous molecules and is thus favored. Moreover, starting with AuNPs already aggregated ensured the absence of a background signal as the dissociation of the assemblies was far from spontaneous. Remarkably, it was possible to dry the AuNP assemblies and solubilize them back with HS-PEGs, improving the colorimetric signal generation. We used this system for protease sensing in biological fluids. Trypsin was chosen as the model enzyme, and highly positively charged peptides were conjugated to HS-PEG molecules as cleavage substrates. The increase of positive charge of the HS-PEG-peptide conjugate quenched the dissociation capacity of the HS-PEG molecules, which could only be restored by the proteolytic cleavage.

However, the rapidly evolving pandemic raises new concerns. One pertains efficacy of adenoviral vector-based vaccines, particularly the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S, relative to mRNA vaccines. We investigated the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA vaccines in 33 subjects vaccinated with either vaccine class 5 months earlier on average. After controlling for the time since vaccination, Spike-binding antibody and neutralizing antibody levels were higher in the mRNA-vaccinated subjects, while no significant differences in antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses were observed between the two groups. A dichotomy exists between the humoral and cellular responses elicited by the two vaccine classes.

Gene and protein expression defines several neutrophil clusters in COVID-19, including the emergence of low density neutrophils (LDN) that are associated with severe disease. The functional capabilities of these neutrophil clusters and correlation with gene and protein expression are unknown. To define host defense and immunosuppressive functions of normal density neutrophils (NDN) and LDN from COVID-19 patients, we recruited 64 patients with severe COVID-19 and 26 healthy donors (HD). Phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and T-cell suppression in those neutrophil subsets were measured. NDN from severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed evidence of priming with enhanced phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, and degranulation of secretory vesicles and gelatinase and specific granules, while NET formation was similar to HD NDN. COVID LDN response was impaired except for enhanced NET formation. A subset of COVID LDN with intermediate CD16 expression (CD16<sup>Int</sup> LDN) promoted T cell proliferation to a level similar to HD NDN, while COVID NDN and the CD16<sup>Hi</sup> LDN failed to stimulate T-cell activation. All 3 COVID-19 neutrophil populations suppressed stimulation of IFN-γ production, compared to HD NDN.

Central to our ability to successfully tackle these diseases is the need to quickly detect the causative virus and neutralize it efficiently. Here we present the rational design of DNA nanostructures to inhibit dengue virus infection. The designer DNA nanostructure (DDN) can bind to complementary epitopes on antigens dispersed across the surface of a viral particle. Since these antigens are arranged in a defined geometric pattern that is unique to each virus, the structure of the DDN is designed to mirror the spatial arrangement of antigens on the viral particle, providing very high viral binding avidity. We describe how available structural data can be used to identify unique spatial patterns of antigens on the surface of a viral particle. We then present a procedure for synthesizing DDNs using a combination of in silico design principles, self-assembly, and characterization using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of a DDN in inhibiting dengue virus infection via plaque-forming assays. We expect this protocol to take 2-3 d to complete virus antigen pattern identification from existing cryogenic electron microscopy data, ~2 weeks for DDN design, synthesis, and virus binding characterization, and ~2 weeks for DDN cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy assays.","Animals|Antigens, Viral|Antiviral Agents|DNA|Dengue|Dengue Virus|Humans|Microscopy, Atomic Force|Nanostructures|Surface Plasmon Resonance","Ren, Shaokang|Fraser, Keith|Kuo, Lili|Chauhan, Neha|Adrian, Addison T|Zhang, Fuming|Linhardt, Robert J|Kwon, Paul S|Wang, Xing",Nature protocols,2022,2022-02-01,Journal Article|Review,AA029348,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

However, the development of exosome-encapsulated drug nanocarriers is limited by low drug loading efficiencies and/or complex, time-consuming drug loading processes. Herein, we have developed an acoustofluidic device that simultaneously performs both drug loading and exosome encapsulation. By synergistically leveraging the acoustic radiation force, acoustic microstreaming, and shear stresses in a rotating droplet, the concentration, and fusion of exosomes, drugs, and porous silica nanoparticles is achieved. The final product consists of drug-loaded silica nanocarriers that are encased within an exosomal membrane. The drug loading efficiency is significantly improved, with nearly 30% of the free drug (e.g., doxorubicin) molecules loaded into the nanocarriers. Furthermore, this acoustofluidic drug loading system circumvents the need for complex chemical modification, allowing drug loading and encapsulation to be completed within a matter of minutes. These exosome-encapsulated nanocarriers exhibit excellent efficiency in intracellular transport and are capable of significantly inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.

At multiple stages during its complex life cycle, P. falciparum expresses several essential proteins tethered to its surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for biological processes such as parasite egress and reinvasion of host red blood cells. Targeting this pathway therapeutically has the potential to broadly impact parasite development across several life stages. Here, we characterize an upstream component of parasite GPI anchor biosynthesis, the putative phosphomannomutase (PMM) (EC 5.4.2.8), HAD5 (PF3D7_1017400). We confirmed the PMM and phosphoglucomutase activities of purified recombinant HAD5 by developing novel linked enzyme biochemical assays. By regulating the expression of HAD5 in transgenic parasites with a TetR-DOZI-inducible knockdown system, we demonstrated that HAD5 is required for malaria parasite egress and erythrocyte reinvasion, and we assessed the role of HAD5 in GPI anchor synthesis by autoradiography of radiolabeled glucosamine and thin layer chromatography. Finally, we determined the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of HAD5 and identified a substrate analog that specifically inhibits HAD5 compared to orthologous human PMMs in a time-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway is exceptionally sensitive to inhibition in parasites and that HAD5 has potential as a specific, multistage antimalarial target.","Animals|Erythrocytes|Glycosylphosphatidylinositols|Humans|Malaria, Falciparum|Phosphotransferases (Phosphomutases)|Plasmodium falciparum|Protozoan Proteins|carbohydrate metabolism|crystal structure|drug development|glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor|haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)|malaria|parasite|phosphomannomutase","Frasse, Philip M|Miller, Justin J|Polino, Alexander J|Soleimani, Ebrahim|Zhu, Jian-She|Jakeman, David L|Jez, Joseph M|Goldberg, Daniel E|Odom John, Audrey R",The Journal of biological chemistry,2022,2022-02-01,Journal Article,HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Longitudinal unbiased proteomic analysis of plasma and single-cell transcriptomics of peripheral blood cells conducted prior to and at multiple times after convalescent plasma transfusion identified the key biological processes associated with the transition from severe disease to disease-free state. These included (i) temporally ordered upward and downward changes in plasma proteins reestablishing homeostasis and (ii) post-transfusion disappearance of a particular subset of dysfunctional monocytes characterized by hyperactivated Interferon responses and decreased TNF-α signaling.

However, currently available tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are too expensive, painful, and irritating, or not sufficiently sensitive for routine, accurate home testing. Herein, we employ custom-formulated graphene inks and aerosol jet printing (AJP) to create a rapid electrochemical immunosensor for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) in saliva samples acquired non-invasively. This sensor demonstrated limits of detection that are considerably lower than most commercial SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (22.91 ± 4.72 pg/mL for Spike RBD and 110.38 ± 9.00 pg/mL for Spike S1) as well as fast response time (~30 mins), which was facilitated by the functionalization of printed graphene electrodes in a single-step with SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody through the carbodiimide reaction without the need for nanoparticle functionalization or secondary antibody or metallic nanoparticle labels. This immunosensor presents a wide linear sensing range from 1 to 1000 ng/mL and does not react with other coexisting influenza viruses such as H1N1 hemagglutinin.

Despite the numerous benefits, sources of variability in sample storage, handling, and processing methods can make WBE data difficult to generalize. We performed an experiment to determine sources of variability in WBE data including the impact of storage time, handling, and processing techniques on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater influent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in North Carolina over 19 days. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration in influent samples held at 4°C did not degrade significantly over the 19-day experiment. Heat pasteurization did not significantly impact the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 at two of the three WWTP but did reduce viral recovery at the WWTP with the smallest population size served. On each processing date, one filter from each sample was processed immediately while a replicate filter was frozen at -80°C. Once processed, filters previously frozen were found to contain slightly higher concentrations (<0.2 log copies/L) than their immediately processed counterparts, indicating freezing filters is a viable method for delayed quantification and may even improve recovery at WWTP with low viral concentrations. Investigation of factors contributing to variability during sample processing indicated that analyst experience level contributed significantly (p<0.001) to accepted droplet generation while extraction efficiency and reverse transcription efficiency contributed significantly (p<0.05) to day-to-day SARS-CoV-2 variability. This study provides valuable practical information for minimizing decay and/or loss of SARS CoV-2 in wastewater influent while adhering to safety procedures, promoting efficient laboratory workflows, and accounting for sources of variability.","COVID-19|Humans|Pandemics|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Wastewater|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","Beattie, Rachelle E|Blackwood, A Denene|Clerkin, Thomas|Dinga, Carly|Noble, Rachel T",PloS one,2022,2022-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",DA053899,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

We performed a prospective longitudinal cohort study evaluating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) IgG positivity along with consistent clinical symptoms in patients with IBD receiving infliximab or vedolizumab. Serum was also obtained following immunization with approved vaccines. The IgG antibody to the spike protein binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assayed with a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using flow cytometry. A sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein onto a lentivirus and measures pseudoviral entry into ACE2-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells was used. There were 436 patients enrolled (mean age, 17 years, range 2-26 years; 58% male; 71% Crohn's disease, 29% ulcerative colitis, IBD-unspecified). Forty-four (10%) of enrolled subjects had SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies. Compared to non-IBD adults (ambulatory) and hospitalized pediatric patients with PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, S-RBD IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in the IBD cohort and by 6 months post infection most patients lacked neutralizing antibody. Following vaccination (n = 33), patients had a 15-fold higher S-RBD antibody response in comparison with natural infection, and all developed neutralizing antibodies to both wild type and variant SARS-CoV-2.

36351199,,doi:10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c02219,Gold-Silver Core-Shell Nanoparticle Crosslinking Mediated by Protease Activity for Colorimetric Enzyme Detection.,"Plasmonic nanoparticles produce a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) under optical excitation. The LSPR of nanoparticles can shift in response to changes in the local dielectric environment and produce a color change. This color change can be observed by the naked eye due to the exceptionally large extinction coefficients (10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) of plasmonic nanoparticles. Herein, we investigate the optical shifts (i.e., color change) of three unique gold-silver core-shell nanoparticle structures in response to changes in their dielectric environment upon nanoparticle aggregation. Aggregation is induced by a cysteine-containing peptide that has a sulfhydryl near its N and C termini, which crosslinks nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding proline spacers between the cysteines impacts the degree of aggregation and, ultimately, the color response. Using this information, we construct a colorimetric enzyme assay, where the signal produced from nanoparticle aggregation is modulated by proteolysis. The degree of aggregation and the resulting optical shift can be correlated with enzyme concentration with high linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). Overall, this study explores the optical properties of gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles in a dispersed vs aggregated state and leverages that information to develop an enzyme sensor with a spectral LOD of 0.47 ± 0.09 nM.",Colorimetry|Gold|Metal Nanoparticles|Peptide Hydrolases|Proteolysis|Silver|Surface Plasmon Resonance,"Creyer, Matthew N|Jin, Zhicheng|Retout, Maurice|Yim, Wonjun|Zhou, Jiajing|Jokerst, Jesse V",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2022,2022-11-22,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DE031114,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

Most patients experiencing refractory hypoxemia will suffer organ dysfunction, and death is common in this cohort. Here, we describe a new strategy to stabilize and support patients using a microfluidic device that administers oxygen gas directly to the bloodstream in real time and on demand using a process that we call sequential shear-induced bubble breakup.

35303007,PMC8955962,doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009883,In vitro machine learning-based CAR T immunological synapse quality measurements correlate with patient clinical outcomes.,"The human immune system consists of a highly intelligent network of billions of independent, self-organized cells that interact with each other. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different ""off-the-shelf"" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

Efforts have been made to use the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to predict the infected population within each sewershed using a multivariable regression approach. However, reported clear and sustained variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral load among treatment facilities receiving industrial wastewater have made clinical prediction challenging. Several classes of molecules released by regional industries and manufacturing facilities, particularly the food processing industry, can significantly suppress the SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater by breaking down the lipid-bilayer of the membranes. Therefore, a systematic ranking process in conjugation with metabolomic analysis was developed to identify the wastewater treatment facilities exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 suppression and identify and quantify the chemicals suppressing the SARS-COV-2 signals. By ranking the viral load per diagnosed case among the sewersheds, we successfully identified the wastewater treatment facilities in Missouri, USA that exhibit SARS-CoV-2 suppression (significantly lower than 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> gene copies/reported case) and determined their suppression rates. Through both untargeted global chemical profiling and targeted analysis of wastewater samples, 40 compounds were identified as candidates of SARS-CoV-2 signal suppressors. Among these compounds, 14 had higher concentrations in wastewater treatment facilities that exhibited SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression compared to the unsuppressed control facilities. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that 4-nonylphenol, palmitelaidic acid, sodium oleate, and polyethylene glycol dioleate are positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression rates. Suppression activities were further confirmed by incubation studies, and the suppression kinetics for each bioactive compound were determined. According to the results of these experiments, bioactive molecules in wastewater can significantly reduce the stability of SARS-CoV-2 genetic marker signals. Based on the concentrations of these chemical suppressors, a correction factor could be developed to achieve more reliable and unbiased surveillance results for wastewater treatment facilities that receive wastewater from similar industries.","COVID-19|Detergents|Humans|Metabolomics|RNA, Viral|SARS-COV-2 suppression|SARS-CoV-2|Surfactants|Wastewater|Wastewater surveillance|Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","Bayati, Mohamed|Hsieh, Hsin-Yeh|Hsu, Shu-Yu|Li, Chenhui|Rogers, Elizabeth|Belenchia, Anthony|Zemmer, Sally A|Blanc, Todd|LePage, Cindy|Klutts, Jessica|Reynolds, Melissa|Semkiw, Elizabeth|Johnson, Hwei-Yiing|Foley, Trevor|Wieberg, Chris G|Wenzel, Jeff|Lyddon, Terri|LePique, Mary|Rushford, Clayton|Salcedo, Braxton|Young, Kara|Graham, Madalyn|Suarez, Reinier|Ford, Anarose|Lei, Zhentian|Sumner, Lloyd|Mooney, Brian P|Wei, Xing|Greenlief, C Michael|Johnson, Marc C|Lin, Chung-Ho",Water research,2022,2022-08-01,Journal Article,DA053893,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Here we show that 30% of adults with COVID-19 had autoantibodies against the lung antigen KCNRG, and 34% had antibodies to the SLE-associated Smith-D3 protein. Children with COVID-19 rarely had autoantibodies; one of 59 children had GAD65 autoantibodies associated with acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes. While autoantibodies associated with SLE/Sjögren's syndrome (Ro52, Ro60, and La) and/or autoimmune gastritis (gastric ATPase) were detected in 74% (40/54) of MIS-C patients, further analysis of these patients and of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), showed that the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was largely responsible for detection of these autoantibodies in both groups of patients. Monitoring <i>in vivo</i> decay of the autoantibodies in MIS-C children showed that the IVIG-derived Ro52, Ro60, and La autoantibodies declined to undetectable levels by 45-60 days, but gastric ATPase autoantibodies declined more slowly requiring >100 days until undetectable. Further testing of IgG and/or IgA antibodies against a subset of potential targets identified by published autoantigen array studies of MIS-C failed to detect autoantibodies against most (16/18) of these proteins in patients with MIS-C who had not received IVIG. However, Troponin C2 and KLHL12 autoantibodies were detected in 2 of 20 and 1 of 20 patients with MIS-C, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that IVIG therapy may be a confounding factor in autoantibody measurements in MIS-C and that antibodies against antigens associated with autoimmune diseases or other human proteins are uncommon in MIS-C.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing|Adenosine Triphosphatases|Adult|Autoantibodies|Autoantigens|Autoimmune Diseases|Autoimmunity|COVID-19|Child|Humans|IVIG|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic|MIS-C multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children|Ribonucleoproteins|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|autoantibodies|autoimmunity","Burbelo, Peter D|Castagnoli, Riccardo|Shimizu, Chisato|Delmonte, Ottavia M|Dobbs, Kerry|Discepolo, Valentina|Lo Vecchio, Andrea|Guarino, Alfredo|Licciardi, Francesco|Ramenghi, Ugo|Rey-Jurado, Emma|Vial, Cecilia|Marseglia, Gian Luigi|Licari, Amelia|Montagna, Daniela|Rossi, Camillo|Montealegre Sanchez, Gina A|Barron, Karyl|Warner, Blake M|Chiorini, John A|Espinosa, Yazmin|Noguera, Loreani|Dropulic, Lesia|Truong, Meng|Gerstbacher, Dana|Mató, Sayonara|Kanegaye, John|Tremoulet, Adriana H||Eisenstein, Eli M|Su, Helen C|Imberti, Luisa|Poli, Maria Cecilia|Burns, Jane C|Notarangelo, Luigi D|Cohen, Jeffrey I",Frontiers in immunology,2022,2022-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105590,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

In general, DNA computation is conducted in individual tubes, is slow in generating chemical outputs in response to chemical inputs and requires fluorescence readout. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for DNA computation where the chemical input is processed and transduced into a mechanical output using dynamic DNA-based motors operating far from equilibrium. We show that DNA-based motors with onboard logic (DMOLs) can perform Boolean functions (NOT, YES, AND and OR) with 15 min readout times. Because DMOLs are micrometre-sized, massive arrays of DMOLs that are identical or uniquely encoded by size and refractive index can be multiplexed and perform motor-to-motor communication on the same chip. Finally, DMOL computational outputs can be detected using a conventional smartphone camera, thus transducing chemical information into the electronic domain in a facile manner, suggesting potential applications.","Computers, Molecular|DNA|Fluorescence|Logic","Piranej, Selma|Bazrafshan, Alisina|Salaita, Khalid",Nature nanotechnology,2022,2022-05-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",AA029345,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Coordinated CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in five MIS-C subjects with cross-reactivity to CCC. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses alone were documented in three and one subjects, respectively. T-cell specificities in MIS-C did not correlate with disease severity and were similar to SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls. T-cell memory and cross-reactivity to CCC in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls were also similar. The chemokine receptor CCR6, but not CCR9, was highly expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ but not on CD8+ T cells. Only two of 10 KD subjects showed a T-cell response to CCC. Enumeration of myeloid APCs revealed low cell precursors in MIS-C subjects compared to KD.

One such protocol involves sample clarification by size fractionation using either low-speed centrifugation to produce a clarified supernatant or membrane filtration to produce an initial filtrate depleted of solids, eukaryotes and bacterial present in wastewater (WW), followed by concentration of virus particles by ultrafiltration of the above. While this approach has been successful in identifying viruses from WW, it assumes that majority of the viruses of interest should be present in the fraction obtained by ultrafiltration of the initial filtrate, with negligible loss of viral particles and viral diversity. We used WW samples collected in a population of ~700,000 in southwest USA between October 2019 and March 2021, targeting three non-enveloped viruses (enteroviruses [EV], canine picornaviruses [CanPV], and human adenovirus 41 [Ad41]), to evaluate whether size fractionation of WW prior to ultrafiltration leads to appreciable differences in the virus presence and diversity determined. We showed that virus presence or absence in WW samples in both portions (filter trapped solids [FTS] and filtrate) are not consistent with each other. We also found that in cases where virus was detected in both fractions, virus diversity (or types) captured either in FTS or filtrate were not consistent with each other. Hence, preferring one fraction of WW over the other can undermine the capacity of WBE to function as an early warning system and negatively impact the accurate representation of virus presence and diversity in a population.",Adenovirus 41|High-throughput nucleotide sequencing|Picornaviridae|Sample clarification by size fractionation|Wastewater-based epidemiological monitoring,"Faleye, Temitope O C|Skidmore, Peter|Elyaderani, Amir|Adhikari, Sangeet|Kaiser, Nicole|Smith, Abriana|Yanez, Allan|Perleberg, Tyler|Driver, Erin M|Halden, Rolf U|Varsani, Arvind|Scotch, Matthew",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022,2022-10-25,Journal Article|Preprint,LM013129,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Although many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. To directly compare the response characteristics of both inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons, we recorded from mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. We observed that chemosensitive profiles of GABAergic taste neurons (G+<sub>TASTE</sub>) were similar to non-GABA taste neurons (G-<sub>TASTE</sub>) but had much lower response rates. We further observed a novel subpopulation of GABA cells located more ventrally in the nucleus that were unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+<sub>UNR</sub>), suggesting pathways for inhibition initiated by centrifugal sources. This preparation also allowed us to determine how optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impacted the taste responses of G-<sub>TASTE</sub> neurons. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-<sub>TASTE</sub> neurons across all qualities and chemosensitive types of neurons. Although the tuning curves of identified G-<sub>TASTE</sub> were modestly sharpened, the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.",Animals|Channelrhodopsins|DREADDs|GABAergic Neurons|Mice|Quinine|Solitary Nucleus|Sucrose|Taste|inhibitory interneurons|optogenetics|solitary nucleus|taste quality coding,"Travers, Susan P|Kalyanasundar, B|Breza, Joseph|Houser, Grace|Klimovich, Charlotte|Travers, Joseph",eNeuro,2022,2022-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Despite several successful implementations of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, including our previous work (Vazquez et al. 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki Disease (KD), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID19. We demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-Seq examination of both MIS-C and KD demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as well as several strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in severe COVID19, including the endosomal protein EEA1.

RADx-rad projects are required to adopt common data elements (CDEs) to collect data to increase data interoperability. To overcome the challenges in finding appropriate CDEs for a wide range of study variables, we create a web application - IMI-CDE to ease the burden of mapping study variables to CDEs from researchers. IMI-CDE can automatically recommend CDE candidates for a study variable based on its name and description. Together with interactive mapping interfaces, IMI-CDE allows researchers to perform variable-CDE mapping with one mouse click. In addition, the IMI-CDE application supports users with multiple roles to work collaboratively on the mapping tasks. We have piloted the IMI-CDE with RADx-rad projects. 22 researchers from 8 different projects have started to use the IMI-CDE system for variable-CDE mappings.

Using a prospective experimental design, air, surface swabs, and wastewater samples were collected from a college dormitory from March to May 2021. Students were randomly screened for COVID-19 during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples was concentrated with electronegative filtration and quantified using Volcano 2 <sup>nd</sup> Generation-qPCR. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the associations between time-lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases. This study was conducted in a residential dormitory at the University of Miami, Coral Gables campus, FL, USA. The dormitory housed about 500 students. Students from the dormitory were randomly screened, for COVID-19 for 2-3 days / week while entering or exiting the dormitory. Clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases were of our main interest. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples was an indicator of the presence of local COVID-19 cases in the dormitory, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the environmental samples several days prior to the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 genomic footprints were detected in air, surface swab and wastewater samples on 52 (63.4%), 40 (50.0%) and 57 (68.6%) days, respectively, during the study period.

Non-potable water reuse represents the largest potential reuse market. Yet economic constraints for new water reuse infrastructure and safety concerns due to microbial water quality, and especially viral pathogen exposure, limit widespread implementation of water reuse. Cost-effective, real-time methods to measure or indicate viral quality of recycled water would do much to instill greater confidence in the practice. This manuscript discusses advancements in monitoring and modeling of viral health risks in the context of water reuse. First, we describe the current wastewater reclamation processes and treatment technologies with an emphasis on virus removal. Second, we review technologies for the measurement of viruses, both culture- and molecular-based, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We introduce promising viral surrogates and specific pathogenic viruses that can serve as indicators of viral risk for water reuse. We suggest metagenomic analyses for viral screening and flow cytometry for quantification of virus-like particles as new approaches to complement more traditional methods. Third, we describe modeling to assess health risks through quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs), the most common strategy to couple data on virus concentrations with human exposure scenarios. We then explore the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to incorporate suites of data from wastewater treatment processes, water quality parameters, and viral surrogates. We recommend ANNs as a means to utilize existing water quality data, alongside new complementary measures of viral quality, to achieve cost-effective strategies to assess risks associated with infectious human viruses in recycled water. Given the review, we conclude that technologies are ready for identifying and implementing viral surrogates for health risk reduction in the next decade.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand BMP4 is being examined as a potential therapeutic for GBMs because it induces differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) to an astrocyte phenotype. ID1 is reported to promote self-renewal and inhibit CSC differentiation. In most cancers, ID1 is transcriptionally upregulated by BMP4 promoting invasion and stemness. This conflicting data bring into question whether BMP signaling is growth suppressive or growth promoting in GBMs. We utilized BMP inhibitors DMH1, JL5, and Ym155 to examine the role of BMP signaling on the growth of GBMs. DMH1 targets BMP type 1 receptors whereas JL5 inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Ym155 does not bind the BMP receptors but rather inhibits BMP signaling by inducing the degradation of BMPR2. We show that JL5, DMH1, and Ym155 decreased the expression of ID1 in SD2 and U87 cells. JL5 and Ym155 also decreased the expression of BMPR2 and its downstream target inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. JL5 treatment resulted in significant cell death and suppressed self-renewal to a greater extent than that induced by BMP4 ligand. The lysosome inhibitor chloroquine increases the localization of BMPR2 to the plasma membrane enhancing JL5-induced downregulation of ID1 and cell death in SD2 cells. We show that BMP signaling is growth promoting in GBMs. These studies suggest the need for development of BMP inhibitors and evaluation as potential therapeutic for GBMs.",BMP|BMP inhibitors|BMPR2|Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4|Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors|Bone Morphogenetic Proteins|Cancer stem cells|Glioblastoma|Humans|ID1|Ligands|Signal Transduction,"Kaye, Joel|Mondal, Arindam|Foty, Ramsey|Jia, Dongxuan|Langenfeld, John",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2022,2022-05-01,Journal Article,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, nanomaterial identification and classification are dependent on the image resolution, the image field of view, and the processing time. Optical microscopes are one of the most widely utilized technologies in laboratories across the world, due to their nondestructive abilities to identify and classify critical micro-sized objects and processes, but identifying and classifying critical nano-sized objects and processes with a conventional microscope are outside of its capabilities, due to the diffraction limit of the optics and small field of view. To overcome these challenges of nanomaterial identification and classification, we developed an intelligent nanoscope that combines machine learning and microsphere array-based imaging to: (1) surpass the diffraction limit of the microscope objective with microsphere imaging to provide high-resolution images; (2) provide large field-of-view imaging without the sacrifice of resolution by utilizing a microsphere array; and (3) rapidly classify nanomaterials using a deep convolution neural network. The intelligent nanoscope delivers more than 46 magnified images from a single image frame so that we collected more than 1000 images within 2 seconds. Moreover, the intelligent nanoscope achieves a 95% nanomaterial classification accuracy using 1000 images of training sets, which is 45% more accurate than without the microsphere array. The intelligent nanoscope also achieves a 92% bacteria classification accuracy using 50 000 images of training sets, which is 35% more accurate than without the microsphere array. This platform accomplished rapid, accurate detection and classification of nanomaterials with miniscule size differences.

This low affinity/selectivity interaction results in not only suboptimal anticancer activity but also induction of adverse effects. CD16a on NK cells binds to the antibody-coated cells, leading to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Recent clinical data have shown that the increased binding affinity between mAb Fc region and CD16a receptor is responsible for significantly improved therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the <i>objective</i> of this study was to develop a bispecific killer cell engager (BiKE) with high affinity and specificity/selectivity toward CD16a receptor for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy. To engineer BiKE, a llama was immunized, then high binding anti-CD16a and anti-HER2 VHH clones were isolated using phage display. ELISA, flow cytometry, and biolayer interferometry (BLI) data showed that the isolated anti-CD16a VHH has high affinity (sub-nanomolar) toward CD16a antigen without cross-reactivity with CD16b-NA1 on neutrophils or CD32b on B cells. Similarly, the data showed that the isolated anti-HER2 VHH has high affinity/specificity toward HER2 antigen. Using a semi-flexible linker, anti-HER2 VHH was recombinantly fused with anti-CD16a VHH to create BiKE:HER2/CD16a. Then, the ability of BiKE:HER2/CD16a to activate NK cells to release cytokines and kill HER2<sup>+</sup> cancer cells was measured. As effector cells, both high-affinity haNK92 (CD16<sup>+</sup>, V176) and low-affinity laNK92 (CD16<sup>+</sup>, F176) cells were used. The data showed that the engineered BiKE:HER2/CD16a activates haNK92 and laNK92 cells to release cytokines much greater than best-in-class mAbs in the clinic. The cytotoxicity data also showed that the developed BiKE induces higher ADCC to both ovarian and breast cancer cells in comparison to Trazimera™ (trastuzumab). According to the BLI data, BiKE:HER2/CD16 recognizes a different epitope on CD16a antigen than IgG-based mAbs; thus, it provides the opportunity for not only monotherapy but also combination therapy with other antibody drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates. Taken together, the data demonstrate the creation of a novel BiKE with high affinity and specificity toward CD16a on NK cells with the potential to elicit a superior therapeutic response in patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> cancer than existing anti-HER2 mAbs.","Antibodies, Monoclonal|Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity|BiKE|CD16a|Cytokines|HER2|Humans|Immunoglobulin G|Immunotherapy|Killer Cells, Natural|NK92 cells|Neoplasms|Receptor, ErbB-2|Trastuzumab|VHH nanobody|bispecific killer cell engager|cancer immunotherapy|ovarian cancer","Nikkhoi, Shahryar Khoshtinat|Li, Geng|Eleya, Suha|Yang, Ge|Vandavasi, Venu Gopal|Hatefi, Arash",Frontiers in immunology,2022,2022-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Requirements include imaging at three to five times surface-coil SNR in cardiac chambers, vascular insertion, steerable-active-navigation into cardiac chambers, operation with ablation catheters, and safe levels of MR-induced heating. ICMRI's 6 mm outer-diameter (OD) metallic-braided shaft had a 2.6 mm OD internal lumen for ablation-catheter insertion. Miniature-Baluns (MBaluns) on ICMRI's 1 m shaft reduced body-coil-induced heating. Distal section was a folded ""star""-shaped imaging-coil mounted on an expandable frame, with an integrated miniature low-noise-amplifier overcoming cable losses. A handle-activated movable-shaft expanded imaging-coil to 35 mm OD for imaging within cardiac-chambers. Four MR-tracking micro-coils enabled navigation and motion-compensation, assuming a tetrahedron-shape when expanded. A second handle-lever enabled distal-tip deflection. ICMRI with a protruding deflectable EP catheter were used for MR-tracked navigation and RFA using a dedicated 3D-slicer user-interface. ICMRI was tested at 3T and 1.5T in swine to evaluate (a) heating, (b) cardiac-chamber access, (c) imaging field-of-view and SNR, and (d) intraprocedural RFA lesion monitoring. The 3T and 1.5T imaging SNR demonstrated >400% SNR boost over a 4 × 4 × 4 cm<sup>3</sup> FOV in the heart, relative to body and spine arrays. ICMRI with MBaluns met ASTM/IEC heating limits during navigation. Tip-deflection allowed navigating ICMRI and EP catheter into atria and ventricles. Acute-lesion long-inversion-time-T1-weighted 3D-imaging (TWILITE) ablation-monitoring using ICMRI required 5:30 min, half the time needed with surface arrays alone. ICMRI assisted EP-catheter navigation to difficult targets and accelerated RFA monitoring.","Animals|Arrhythmias, Cardiac|Catheter Ablation|Equipment Design|Heart Atria|Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Swine|acute RF lesion imaging|cardiac electrophysiology|interventional MRI","Schmidt, Ehud J|Olson, Gregory|Tokuda, Junichi|Alipour, Akbar|Watkins, Ronald D|Meyer, Eric M|Elahi, Hassan|Stevenson, William G|Schweitzer, Jeffrey|Dumoulin, Charles L|Johnson, Thomas|Kolandaivelu, Aravindan|Loew, Wolfgang|Halperin, Henry R",Magnetic resonance in medicine,2022,2022-06-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Here we report a novel self-immolative fluorescent probe (MP590) for the highly selective and sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>). This fluorescent probe was prepared by connecting a M<sup>pro</sup>-cleavable peptide (<i>N</i>-acetyl-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln) with a fluorophore (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., resorufin) via a self-immolative aromatic linker. Fluorescent titration results show that MP590 can detect M<sup>pro</sup> with a limit of detection (LoD) of 35 nM and is selective over interferents such as hemoglobin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), thrombin, amylase, SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>), and trypsin. The cell imaging data indicate that this probe can report M<sup>pro</sup> in HEK 293T cells transfected with a M<sup>pro</sup> expression plasmid as well as in TMPRSS2-VeroE6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.

35992634,PMC9386735,doi:10.3389/fsens.2022.917380,Development of a Biosensor Based on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection in Human Saliva.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Infection in humans requires angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) as the point of entry for SARS-CoV-2. PCR testing is generally definitive but expensive, although it is highly sensitive and accurate. Biosensor-based monitoring could be a low-cost, accurate, and non-invasive approach to improve testing capacity. We develop a capacitive hACE2 biosensor for intact SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes were modified with platinum nanoparticles. The quality control of LIG electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry. Truncated hACE2 was used as a biorecognition element and attached to the electrode surface by streptavidin-biotin coupling. Biolayer interferometry was used for qualitative interaction screening of hACE2 with UV-attenuated virions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for signal transduction. Truncated hACE2 binds wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with greater avidity than human coronavirus (common cold virus). The limit of detection (LoD) is estimated to be 2,960 copies/ml. The detection process usually takes less than 30 min. The strength of these features makes the hACE2 biosensor a potentially low-cost approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 in non-clinical settings with high demand for rapid testing (for example, schools and airports).",LIG electrodes|attenuated virus|betacoronavirus|biosensing|human ACE2|saliva diagnostics,"Moreira, Geisianny|Casso-Hartmann, Lisseth|Datta, Shoumen Palit Austin|Dean, Delphine|McLamore, Eric|Vanegas, Diana",Frontiers in sensors,2022,2022-01-01,Journal Article,AA029328,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing

Although COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, there remains a need for rapid testing to limit viral spread from infected individuals. We previously identified the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) binding DNA aptamer 1 (SNAP1) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by aptamer-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and lateral flow assay (LFA). In this work, we identify a new aptamer that also binds at the NTD, named SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTD-binding DNA aptamer 4 (SNAP4). SNAP4 binds with high affinity (<30 nM) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a 2-fold improvement over SNAP1. Furthermore, we utilized both SNAP1 and SNAP4 in an aptamer sandwich LFA (AptaFlow), which detected SARS-CoV-2 UV-inactivated virus at concentrations as low as 10<sup>6</sup> copies/mL. AptaFlow costs <$1 per test to produce, provides results in <1 h, and detects SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations that indicate higher viral loads and a high probability of contagious transmission. AptaFlow is a potential approach for a low-cost, convenient antigen test to aid the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Antibodies, Viral|Aptamers, Nucleotide|COVID-19|COVID-19 Vaccines|Humans|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","Yang, Lucy F|Kacherovsky, Nataly|Panpradist, Nuttada|Wan, Ruixuan|Liang, Joey|Zhang, Bo|Salipante, Stephen J|Lutz, Barry R|Pun, Suzie H",Analytical chemistry,2022,2022-05-24,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",LM013755,,,,,,U24,False,RADx-rad,Data Coordinating Center
35513850,PMC9074288,doi:10.1186/s13073-022-01048-4,A dynamic single cell-based framework for digital twins to prioritize disease genes and drug targets.,"Medical digital twins are computational disease models for drug discovery and treatment. Unresolved problems include how to organize and prioritize between disease-associated changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales. We present a dynamic framework that can be used to model such changes and thereby prioritize upstream regulators (URs) for biomarker- and drug discovery. We started with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model, by analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SAR patients. Time-series a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of these cells were used to construct multicellular network models (MNMs) at each time point of molecular interactions between cell types. We hypothesized that predicted molecular interactions between cell types in the MNMs could be traced to find an UR gene, at an early time point. We performed bioinformatic and functional studies of the MNMs to develop a scalable framework to prioritize UR genes. This framework was tested on a single-cell and bulk-profiling data from SAR and other inflammatory diseases. Our scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs. We present a scalable framework for modeling dynamic changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales, to prioritize UR genes for biomarker and drug discovery.","Biomarkers|Computational Biology|Gene Expression Profiling|Humans|Inflammatory diseases|Leukocytes, Mononuclear|Multicellular network models|ScRNA-seq|Single-Cell Analysis|Upstream regulators","Li, Xinxiu|Lee, Eun Jung|Lilja, Sandra|Loscalzo, Joseph|Schäfer, Samuel|Smelik, Martin|Strobl, Maria Regina|Sysoev, Oleg|Wang, Hui|Zhang, Huan|Zhao, Yelin|Gawel, Danuta R|Bohle, Barbara|Benson, Mikael",Genome medicine,2022,2022-05-06,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Early detection of MIS-C is a challenge given its clinical similarities to Kawasaki disease and other acute febrile childhood illnesses. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm that can distinguish among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses and aid in the diagnosis of patients in the emergency department and acute care setting. In this retrospective model development and validation study, we developed a deep-learning algorithm called KIDMATCH (Kawasaki Disease vs Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) using patient age, the five classic clinical Kawasaki disease signs, and 17 laboratory measurements. All features were prospectively collected at the time of initial evaluation from patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease or other febrile illness between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2019, at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego (CA, USA). For patients with MIS-C, the same data were collected from patients between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021, at Rady Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford (CT, USA), and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CA, USA). We trained a two-stage model consisting of feedforward neural networks to distinguish between patients with MIS-C and those without and then those with Kawasaki disease and other febrile illnesses. After internally validating the algorithm using stratified tenfold cross-validation, we incorporated a conformal prediction framework to tag patients with erroneous data or distribution shifts. We finally externally validated KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C enrolled between April 22, 2020, and July 21, 2021, from Boston Children's Hospital (MA, USA), Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals. 1517 patients diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital between Jan 1, 2009, and June 7, 2021, with MIS-C (n=69), Kawasaki disease (n=775), or other febrile illnesses (n=673) were identified for internal validation, with an additional 16 patients with MIS-C included from Connecticut Children's Medical Center and 50 from Children's Hospital Los Angeles between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021. KIDMATCH achieved a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve during internal validation of 98·8% (IQR 98·0-99·3) in the first stage and 96·0% (95·6-97·2) in the second stage. We externally validated KIDMATCH on 175 patients with MIS-C from Boston Children's Hospital (n=50), Children's National Hospital (n=42), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals (n=83). External validation of KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C correctly classified 76 of 81 patients (94% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from 14 hospitals in the CHARMS Study Group consortium, 47 of 49 patients (96% accuracy, one rejected by conformal prediction) from Boston Children's Hospital, and 36 of 40 patients (90% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from Children's National Hospital.

While RGS2 promoter variants rs2746071 and rs2746072 associate with a clinical mild asthma phenotype, their impact on human airway smooth muscle (HASM) contractility and asthma severity outcomes is unknown. We sought to determine whether reductions in RGS2 expression seen with these 2 RGS2 promoter variants augment HASM contractility and associate with an asthma severity phenotype. We transfected HASM with a range of RGS2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) concentrations and determined RGS2 protein expression by Western blot analysis and intracellular calcium flux induced by histamine (a Gαq-coupled H1 receptor bronchoconstrictive agonist). We conducted regression-based genotype association analyses of RGS2 variants from 611 patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program 3. RGS2-specific siRNA caused dose-dependent increases in histamine-stimulated bronchoconstrictive intracellular calcium signaling (2-way ANOVA, P < .0001) with a concomitant decrease in RGS2 protein expression. RGS2-specific siRNA did not affect Gαq-independent ionomycin-induced intracellular calcium signaling (P = .42).

Here, we present Sample-Intrinsic microbial DNA Found by Tagging and sequencing (SIFT-seq) a metagenomic sequencing assay that is robust against environmental DNA contamination introduced during sample preparation. The core idea of SIFT-seq is to tag the DNA in the sample prior to DNA isolation and library preparation with a label that can be recorded by DNA sequencing. Any contaminating DNA that is introduced in the sample after tagging can then be bioinformatically identified and removed. We applied SIFT-seq to screen for infections from microorganisms with low burden in blood and urine, to identify COVID-19 co-infection, to characterize the urinary microbiome, and to identify microbial DNA signatures of sepsis and inflammatory bowel disease in blood.","COVID-19|DNA|DNA Contamination|DNA, Bacterial|DNA, Environmental|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Humans|Metagenomics|Sequence Analysis, DNA","Mzava, Omary|Cheng, Alexandre Pellan|Chang, Adrienne|Smalling, Sami|Djomnang, Liz-Audrey Kounatse|Lenz, Joan Sesing|Longman, Randy|Steadman, Amy|Gómez-Escobar, Luis G|Schenck, Edward J|Salvatore, Mirella|Satlin, Michael J|Suthanthiran, Manikkam|Lee, John R|Mason, Christopher E|Dadhania, Darshana|De Vlaminck, Iwijn",Nature communications,2022,2022-07-21,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Simultaneous collection of breath VOCs and background environmental VOCs is important to ensure analyses eliminate exogenous compounds from clinical studies. We present a mobile sampling system to extract gaseous VOCs onto commercially available sorbent-packed thermal desorption tubes. The sampler can be connected to a number of commonly available disposable and reusable sampling bags, in the case of this study, a Tedlar bag containing a breath sample. Alternatively, the inlet can be left open to directly sample room or environmental air when obtaining a background VOC sample. The system contains a screen for the operator to input a desired sample volume. A needle valve allows the operator to control the sample flow rate, which operates with an accuracy of -1.52 ± 0.63% of the desired rate, and consistently generated that rate with 0.12 ± 0.06% error across repeated measures. A flow pump, flow sensor and microcontroller allow volumetric sampling, as opposed to timed sampling, with 0.06 ± 0.06% accuracy in the volume extracted. Four samplers were compared by sampling a standard chemical mixture, which resulted in 6.4 ± 4.7% error across all four replicate modular samplers to extract a given VOC. The samplers were deployed in a clinical setting to collect breath and background/environmental samples, including patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the device could easily move between rooms and can undergo required disinfection protocols to prevent transmission of pathogens on the case exterior.

KD remains a clinical diagnosis for which there is no diagnostic test, yet there are classic findings on exam that can be captured in a photograph. This study aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network, KD-CNN, to differentiate photographs of KD clinical signs from those of other pediatric illnesses. To create the dataset, we used an innovative combination of crowdsourcing images and downloading from public domains on the Internet. KD-CNN was then pretrained using transfer learning from VGG-16 and fine-tuned on the KD dataset, and methods to compensate for limited data were explored to improve model performance and generalizability. KD-CNN achieved a median AUC of 0.90 (IQR 0.10 from tenfold cross validation), with a sensitivity of 0.80 (IQR 0.18) and specificity of 0.85 (IQR 0.19) to distinguish between children with and without clinical manifestations of KD.

However, there are real-world risks of incorrect models being submitted to the learning process, due to either unforeseen accidents or malicious intent. This may reduce the incentives for institutions to participate in the federated modeling consortium. Existing methods to deal with this ""model misconduct"" issue mainly focus on modifying the learning methods, and therefore are more specifically tied with the algorithm. In this paper, we aim at solving the problem in an algorithm-agnostic way by (1) designing a simulator to generate various types of model misconduct, (2) developing a framework to detect the model misconducts, and (3) providing a generalizable approach to identify model misconducts for federated learning. We considered the following three categories: Plagiarism, Fabrication, and Falsification, and then developed a detection framework with three components: Auditing, Coefficient, and Performance detectors, with greedy parameter tuning. We generated 10 types of misconducts from models learned on three datasets to evaluate our detection method. Our experiments showed high recall with low added computational cost. Our proposed detection method can best identify the misconduct on specific sites from any learning iteration, whereas it is more challenging to precisely detect misconducts for a specific site and at a specific iteration.

In commercial nurseries, asymptomatic infections of nursery stock by <i>P. ramorum</i> and other <i>Phytophthora</i> species create unacceptable risk and complicate inspection and certification programs designed to prevent introduction and spread of these pathogens. In this study, we continue development of a volatile organic compound (VOC)-based test for detecting asymptomatic infections of <i>P. ramorum</i> in <i>Rhododendron</i> sp. We confirmed detection of <i>P. ramorum</i> from volatiles collected from asymptomatic root-inoculated <i>Rhododendron</i> plants in a nursery setting, finding that the VOC profile of infected plants is detectably different from that of healthy plants, when measured from both ambient VOC emissions and VOCs extracted from leaf material. Predicting infection status was successful from ambient volatiles, which had a mean area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.71 ± 0.17, derived from corresponding receiver operating characteristic curves from an extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis. This finding compares with that of extracted leaf volatiles, which resulted in a lower AUC value of 0.51 ± 0.21.

To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs.

We determined whether dysfunction is global or regional, and whether it is associated with the cytokine milieu, microangiopathy, or severity of shock. Methods and Results We analyzed echocardiographic parameters of myocardial deformation and compared global and segmental left ventricular strain between 43 cases with MIS-C ≤18 years old and 40 controls. Primary outcomes included left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain), and left atrial strain. We evaluated relationships between strain and profiles of 10 proinflammatory cytokines, microangiopathic features (soluble C5b9), and vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Compared with controls, cases with MIS-C had significant impairments in all parameters of systolic and diastolic function. 65% of cases with MIS-C had abnormal left ventricular function (<b>|</b>global longitudinal strain<b>|</b><17%), although elevations of cytokines were modest. All left ventricular segments were involved, without apical or basal dominance to suggest acute stress cardiomyopathy. Worse global longitudinal strain correlated with higher ratios of interleukin-6 (ρ -0.43) and interleukin-8 (ρ -0.43) to total hypercytokinemia, but not absolute levels of interleukin-6 or interleukin-8, or total hypercytokinemia. Similarly, worse right ventricular free wall strain correlated with higher relative interleukin-8 expression (ρ -0.59). There were no significant associations between function and microangiopathy or vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Conclusions Myocardial function is globally decreased in MIS-C and not explained by acute stress cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction may be driven by the relative skew of the immune response toward interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 pathways, more so than degree of hyperinflammation, refining the current paradigm of myocardial involvement in MIS-C.","Adolescent|Age Factors|Atrial Function, Left|Biomarkers|COVID-19|COVID‐19|Child|Cross-Sectional Studies|Cytokine Release Syndrome|Cytokines|Echocardiography|Female|Heart Diseases|Humans|Inflammation Mediators|Male|Prognosis|Retrospective Studies|Risk Assessment|Risk Factors|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|Ventricular Function, Left|Ventricular Function, Right|cytokine storm|echocardiography|multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children|myocardial deformation","Chang, Joyce C|Matsubara, Daisuke|Morgan, Ryan W|Diorio, Caroline|Nadaraj, Sumekala|Teachey, David T|Bassiri, Hamid|Behrens, Edward M|Banerjee, Anirban",Journal of the American Heart Association,2021,2021-08-17,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task (subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets. We evaluate the performance using three real-world healthcare datasets with applications to multi-stage disease progression diagnosis. Our experiments indicate that the proposed MTOR models markedly improve the prediction performance comparing with single-task ordinal regression models.",Deep neural network|Diagnosis|Heterogeneous data|Multi-stage disease progression|Multi-task learning|Ordinal regression|non-IID learning,"Wang, Lu|Zhu, Dongxiao",Data mining and knowledge discovery,2021,2021-05-01,Journal Article,HD105610,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

A comparison of US hospitalization rates and epidemiologic features of KD in 2020 to those of precoronavirus disease years has yet to be reported. Using a large, inpatient database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study and analyzed data for patients with (1) diagnosis coding for KD, (2) IV immunoglobulin treatment administered during hospitalization and (3) discharge date between January 1, 2016, and December 30, 2020. Severe cases were defined as those requiring adjunctive therapy or IV immunoglobulin-resistant therapy. The annual number of KD hospitalizations were stable from 2016 to 2019 (n = 1652, 1796, 1748, 1692, respectively) but decreased in 2020 (n = 1383). KD hospitalizations demonstrated seasonal variation with an annual peak between December and April. A second peak of KD admissions was observed in May 2020. The proportion of KD cases classified as severe increased to 40% in 2020 from 33% during the years 2016-2019 (P < 0.01). Median age in years increased from 2.9 in subjects hospitalized from 2016 to 2019 to 3.2 in 2020 (P = 0.002). Compared with the previous 4 years, the annual number of pediatric KD admissions decreased, and children discharged with diagnostic codes for KD in 2020 were generally older and more likely to have severe morbidity possibly reflective of misdiagnosed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Clinicians should be wary of a possible rise in KD rates in the postcoronavirus disease 2019 era as social distancing policies are lifted and other viruses associated with KD return.","Adolescent|COVID-19|Child|Child, Preschool|Female|History, 21st Century|Hospitalization|Humans|Incidence|Infant|Male|Mortality|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|Seasons|Severity of Illness Index","Phamduy, Timothy T|Smith, Sharon|Herbst, Katherine W|Phamduy, Paul T|Brimacombe, Michael|Hogan, Alexander H|Salazar, Juan C|Sturm, Jesse",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2021,2021-11-01,Historical Article|Journal Article,HD105613,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Over the last 20-30 years, there has been increasing appreciation that ""severe asthma"" encompasses multiple different subgroups or phenotypes, each with differing presentations. Using clinical phenotyping, in combination with rapidly advancing molecular tools and targeted monoclonal antibodies (human knockouts), the understanding of these phenotypes, and our ability to treat them, have greatly advanced. Type-2 (T2)-high and -low severe asthmas are now easily identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current ""breakthrough"" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated. Nevertheless, conceptual understanding of ""the severe asthmas"" has evolved dramatically in a mere 25 years, leading to dramatic improvements in the lives of many.","Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Anti-Asthmatic Agents|Antibodies, Monoclonal|Asthma|Biomarkers|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Molecular Targeted Therapy|Phenotype|Severity of Illness Index|asthma|biologic therapy|cytokines|eosinophils|type 2 asthma","Wenzel, Sally E",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2021,2021-04-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Indeed, a principal goal in PAH today is an early diagnosis for prompt initiation of treatment to achieve a minimal symptom burden; optimize the patient's biochemical, hemodynamic, and functional profile; and limit adverse events. To accomplish this end, clinicians must be familiar with novel risk factors and the revised hemodynamic definition for PAH. Fresh insights into the role of developmental biology (i.e., perinatal health) may also be useful for predicting incident PAH in early adulthood. Emergent or underused approaches to PAH management include a novel TGF-β ligand trap pharmacotherapy, remote pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring, next-generation imaging using inert gas-based magnetic resonance and other technologies, right atrial pacing, and pulmonary arterial denervation. These and other PAH state of the art advances are summarized here for the wider pulmonary medicine community.","Adult|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Cardiac Catheterization|Cardiac Surgical Procedures|Early Diagnosis|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|Risk Factors|Therapies, Investigational|pulmonary arterial hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|risk stratification|treatment","Maron, Bradley A|Abman, Steven H|Elliott, C Greg|Frantz, Robert P|Hopper, Rachel K|Horn, Evelyn M|Nicolls, Mark R|Shlobin, Oksana A|Shah, Sanjiv J|Kovacs, Gabor|Olschewski, Horst|Rosenzweig, Erika B",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2021,2021-06-15,"Case Reports|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

A prospective cohort (n = 831) previously undiagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent serial testing (SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, immunoglobulin G [IgG]) for 6 months. Ninety-three participants (11.2%) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive: 14 (15.1%) asymptomatic, 24 (25.8%) severely symptomatic. Healthcare workers (n = 548) were more likely to become infected (14.2% vs 5.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.3) and severely symptomatic (29.5% vs 6.7%). IgG antibodies were detected after 79% of asymptomatic infections, 89% with mild-moderate symptoms, and 96% with severe symptoms. IgG trajectories after asymptomatic infections (slow increases) differed from symptomatic infections (early peaks within 2 months). Most participants (92%) had persistent IgG responses (median 171 days). In multivariable models, IgG titers were positively associated with symptom severity, certain comorbidities, and hospital work. Dyspnea and neurologic changes (including altered smell/taste) lasted ≥ 120 days in ≥ 10% of affected participants. Prolonged symptoms (frequently more severe) corresponded to higher antibody levels. In a prospective, ethnically diverse cohort, symptom severity correlated with the magnitude and trajectory of IgG production.

Because liver plays a pivotal role during obesity, we hypothesized that miR-181c might contribute to the pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. Therefore, we used miR-181c/d-/- mice to study the role of miR-181c in hepatocyte lipogenesis during diet-induced obesity. The mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, during which indirect calorimetric measurements were made. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. We found that miR-181c/d-/- mice were not protected against all metabolic consequences of HF exposure. After 26 weeks, the miR-181c/d-/- mice had a significantly higher body fat percentage than did wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d-/- mice. miR-181c/d-/- mice fed the HF diet had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels than did WT mice fed the same diet. qPCR data showed that several genes regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were more upregulated in miR-181c/d-/- liver than in WT liver. Furthermore, miR-181c delivered in vivo via adeno-associated virus attenuated the lipogenesis by downregulating these same lipid synthesis genes in the liver. In hepatocytes, miR-181c regulates lipid biosynthesis by targeting IDH1. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of miR-181c can be beneficial for various lipid metabolism disorders.","Animals|Diet, High-Fat|Hepatocytes|Lipogenesis|Liver|Male|Mice|Mice, Knockout|MicroRNAs|Obesity|Triglycerides","Akiyoshi, Kei|Boersma, Gretha J|Johnson, Miranda D|Velasquez, Fernanda Carrizo|Dunkerly-Eyring, Brittany|O'Brien, Shannon|Yamaguchi, Atsushi|Steenbergen, Charles|Tamashiro, Kellie L K|Das, Samarjit",PloS one,2021,2021-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",TR003780,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,Exosome

Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation. Children with MIS-C present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in children with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of disease. We show that protein signatures demonstrate overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is an important marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA. We find that IFNγ responses are dysregulated in MIS-C patients, and that IFNγ levels delineate clinical heterogeneity.","Biomarkers|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Chemokine CXCL9|Child|Endothelium, Vascular|Group II Phospholipases A2|Humans|Inflammation|Interferon-gamma|Interleukin-10|Proteome|Proteomics|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|Vascular Diseases","Diorio, Caroline|Shraim, Rawan|Vella, Laura A|Giles, Josephine R|Baxter, Amy E|Oldridge, Derek A|Canna, Scott W|Henrickson, Sarah E|McNerney, Kevin O|Balamuth, Frances|Burudpakdee, Chakkapong|Lee, Jessica|Leng, Tomas|Farrel, Alvin|Lambert, Michele P|Sullivan, Kathleen E|Wherry, E John|Teachey, David T|Bassiri, Hamid|Behrens, Edward M",Nature communications,2021,2021-12-10,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Somatic missense mutations are also significantly enriched in PPI interfaces compared to noninterfaces in 10,861 tumor exomes. We computationally identified 470 putative oncoPPIs in a pan-cancer analysis and demonstrate that oncoPPIs are highly correlated with patient survival and drug resistance/sensitivity. We experimentally validate the network effects of 13 oncoPPIs using a systematic binary interaction assay, and also demonstrate the functional consequences of two of these on tumor cell growth. In summary, this human interactome network framework provides a powerful tool for prioritization of alleles with PPI-perturbing mutations to inform pathobiological mechanism- and genotype-based therapeutic discovery.","Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase|Arginine|Computational Biology|Disease|Genome, Human|Histones|Humans|Mutation|Neoplasms|Pharmacogenomic Testing|Proprotein Convertase 9|Protein Interaction Maps|Receptors, LDL|Reproducibility of Results|Serine|rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor alpha|rhoA GTP-Binding Protein","Cheng, Feixiong|Zhao, Junfei|Wang, Yang|Lu, Weiqiang|Liu, Zehui|Zhou, Yadi|Martin, William R|Wang, Ruisheng|Huang, Jin|Hao, Tong|Yue, Hong|Ma, Jing|Hou, Yuan|Castrillon, Jessica A|Fang, Jiansong|Lathia, Justin D|Keri, Ruth A|Lightstone, Felice C|Antman, Elliott Marshall|Rabadan, Raul|Hill, David E|Eng, Charis|Vidal, Marc|Loscalzo, Joseph",Nature genetics,2021,2021-03-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in treating COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its various mutants. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAbs) that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and is therefore more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G, N501Y, and E484K mutants. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein <i>in vitro</i> and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently reported CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.","A549 Cells|CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)|COVID-19|E484K variant|Gene Expression Regulation|Hep G2 Cells|Humans|Killer Cells, Natural|N501Y variant|NK cells|Receptors, Chimeric Antigen|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|off-the-shelf","Ma, Minh Tuyet|Badeti, Saiaditya|Chen, Chih-Hsiung|Kim, James|Choudhary, Alok|Honnen, Bill|Reichman, Charles|Calianese, David|Pinter, Abraham|Jiang, Qingkui|Shi, Lanbo|Zhou, Renping|Xu, Huanbin|Li, Qingsheng|Gause, William|Liu, Dongfang",Frontiers in immunology,2021,2021-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, efficient translation of CRISPR-diagnostic technologies to field application is still hampered by dependence on target amplification and by reliance on fluorescence-based results readout. Herein, an amplification-free CRISPR/Cas12a-based diagnostic technology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is presented using a smartphone camera for results readout. This method, termed Cellphone-based amplification-free system with CRISPR/CAS-dependent enzymatic (CASCADE) assay, relies on mobile phone imaging of a catalase-generated gas bubble signal within a microfluidic channel and does not require any external hardware optical attachments. Upon specific detection of a SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcribed DNA/RNA heteroduplex target (orf1ab) by the ribonucleoprotein complex, the transcleavage collateral activity of the Cas12a protein on a Catalase:ssDNA probe triggers the bubble signal on the system. High analytical sensitivity in signal detection without previous target amplification (down to 50 copies µL<sup>-1</sup>) is observed in spiked samples, in ≈71 min from sample input to results readout.

We aimed to assess whether quantitative computed tomography (qCT) metrics are associated with longitudinal decline in lung function and morbidity in asthma. We analyzed 205 qCT scans of adult patients with asthma and calculated baseline markers of airway remodeling, lung density, and pointwise regional change in lung volume (Jacobian measures) for each participant. Using multivariable regression models, we then assessed the association of qCT measurements with the outcomes of future change in lung function, future exacerbation rate, and changes in validated measurements of morbidity. Greater baseline wall area percent (β = -0.15 [95% CI = -0.26 to -0.05]; P < .01), hyperinflation percent (β = -0.25 [95% CI = -0.41 to -0.09]; P < .01), and Jacobian gradient measurements (cranial-caudal β = 10.64 [95% CI = 3.79-17.49]; P < .01; posterior-anterior β = -9.14, [95% CI = -15.49 to -2.78]; P < .01) were associated with more severe future lung function decline.

We hypothesized that participants with the smallest responses to parenteral corticosteroids have the greatest risk of undergoing a severe decline in lung function.<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate corticosteroid-response phenotypes as longitudinal predictors of lung decline.<b>Methods:</b> Adults within the NHLBI SARP III (Severe Asthma Research Program III) who had undergone a course of intramuscular triamcinolone at baseline and at ≥2 annual follow-up visits were evaluated. Longitudinal slopes were calculated for each participant's post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted. Categories of participant FEV<sub>1</sub> slope were defined: severe decline, >2% loss/yr; mild decline, >0.5-2.0% loss/yr; no change, 0.5% loss/yr to <1% gain/yr; and improvement, ≥1% gain/yr. Regression models were used to develop predictors of severe decline.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Of 396 participants, 78 had severe decline, 91 had mild decline, 114 had no change, and 113 showed improvement.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of the syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), as well as human ACE2 expression vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays.

We ascertained the time course of intradialytic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) in MHD patients between 4 weeks pre-diagnosis and the week post-diagnosis of COVID-19. We conducted a quality improvement project in confirmed COVID-19 in-center MHD patients from 11 dialysis facilities. In patients with an arterio-venous access, SaO<sub>2</sub> was measured 1×/min during dialysis using the Crit-Line monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, USA). We extracted demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data, and COVID-19-related symptoms from the patients' electronic health records. Intradialytic SaO<sub>2</sub> was available in 52 patients (29 males; mean ± standard deviation age 66.5 ± 15.7 years) contributing 338 HD treatments. Mean time between onset of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 1.1 days (median 0; range 0-9). Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis the rate of HD treatments with hypoxemia, defined as treatment-level average SaO<sub>2</sub> <90%, increased from 2.8% (2-4 weeks pre-diagnosis) to 12.2% (1 week) and 20.7% (3 days pre-diagnosis). Intradialytic O<sub>2</sub> supplementation increased sharply post-diagnosis. Eleven patients died from COVID-19 within 5 weeks. Compared with patients who recovered from COVID-19, demised patients showed a more pronounced decline in SaO<sub>2</sub> prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In HD patients, hypoxemia may precede the onset of clinical symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19. A steep decline of SaO<sub>2</sub> is associated with poor patient outcomes.

Peak serum troponin I levels during sepsis were grouped as normal (⩽0.04 ng/ml) or tertiles of abnormal (>0.04 to ⩽0.09 ng/ml, >0.09 to ⩽0.42 ng/ml, or >0.42 ng/ml). Multivariable adjusted cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with death as a competing risk were used to assess associations between peak troponin I levels and a composite cardiovascular outcome (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) in the year following sepsis. Models were adjusted for presepsis and intrasepsis factors considered potential confounders.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Among 14,046 eligible adults with troponin I measured, 2,012 (14.3%) experienced the composite cardiovascular outcome, including 832 (10.9%) patients with normal troponin levels, as compared with 370 (17.3%), 376 (17.6%), and 434 (20.3%) patients within each sequential abnormal troponin tertile, respectively (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Patients within the elevated troponin tertiles had increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]<sub>troponin0.04-0.09</sub> = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.55; aHR<sub>troponin0.09-0.42</sub> = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27-1.63; and aHR<sub>troponin>0.42</sub> = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56-2.00).<b>Conclusions:</b> Among patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease, troponin elevation during sepsis identified patients at increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications.

Previously developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) point-of-care devices are based on the specific molecular recognition using subunit protein antibodies and protein receptors that selectively capture the viral proteins. However, these necessarily involve complex and lengthy development and processing times and are notoriously prone to a loss of biological activity upon sensor immobilization and device interfacing, potentially limiting their use in applications at scale. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for nanoparticle corona interfaces that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any antibody and receptor design. Our nanosensor constructs consist of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)─phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that recognize the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 using unique three-dimensional (3D) nanosensor interfaces. This results in rapid and label-free nIR fluorescence detection. This antibody-free nanosensor shows up to 50% sensor responses within 5 min of viral protein injections with limit of detection (LOD) values of 48 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate instrumentation based on a fiber-optic platform that interfaces the advantages of antibody-free molecular recognition and biofluid compatibility in human saliva conditions.","Antibodies, Viral|COVID-19|Humans|Nanotubes, Carbon|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","Cho, Soo-Yeon|Jin, Xiaojia|Gong, Xun|Yang, Sungyun|Cui, Jianqiao|Strano, Michael S",Analytical chemistry,2021,2021-11-09,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DE030829,,,,,,R42,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

It maintains immune homeostasis and mediates tissue repair after injury. Inflammatory diseases of the airways are associated with failure of epithelial functions, including loss of barrier integrity that results in increased tissue permeability and immune activation; excessive mucus secretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that leads to airflow obstruction and microbial overgrowth; and dysregulation of cellular signals that promotes inflammation and alters tissue structure and airway reactivity. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in mounting appropriate cellular responses to environmental stimuli and preventing disease, using a common machinery and mechanism to regulate gene expression in epithelial cells, immune cells of hematopoietic origin, and other cellular components of the airways. Respiratory diseases are accompanied by dramatic changes in epithelial miRNA expression that drive persistent immune dysregulation. In this review, we discuss responses of the epithelium that promote airway immunopathology, with a focus on miRNAs that contribute to the breakdown of essential epithelial functions.

However, there remains a lack of research focused primarily on the young adult population. To describe the epidemiology and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 and identify the risk factors associated with critical illness and mortality in hospitalized young adults. A retrospective cohort study of the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry. Patients 18-40 years old, hospitalized from coronavirus disease 2019 from March 2020 to April 2021, were included in the analysis. Critical illness was defined as a composite of mortality and 21 predefined interventions and complications. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations with critical illness and mortality. Data from 4,005 patients (152 centers, 19 countries, 18.6% non-U.S. patients) were analyzed. The median age was 32 years (interquartile range, 27-37 yr); 51% were female, 29.4% Hispanic, and 42.9% had obesity. Most patients (63.2%) had comorbidities, the most common being hypertension (14.5%) and diabetes (13.7%). Hospital and ICU mortality were 3.2% (129/4,005) and 8.3% (109/1,313), respectively. Critical illness occurred in 25% (<i>n</i> = 996), and 34.3% (<i>n</i> = 1,376) were admitted to the ICU. Older age (<i>p</i> = 0.03), male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]), and obesity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) were associated with hospital mortality. In addition to the above factors, the presence of any comorbidity was associated with critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019. Multiple sensitivity analyses, including analysis with U.S. patients only and patients admitted to high-volume sites, showed similar risk factors.

We built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system for the detection of aberrant physiological and activity signals (e.g. resting heart rate, steps) associated with early infection onset at the individual level. Upon applying this system to a cohort of 3,246 participants, we found that alerts were generated for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections in 78% of cases, and pre-symptomatic signals were observed a median of three days prior to symptom onset. Furthermore, by examining over 100,000 survey annotations, we found that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with COVID-19 (e.g. stress, alcohol consumption, travel) could trigger alerts, albeit at a lower mean period (1.9 days) than those observed in the COVID-19 cases (4.3 days). Thus this system has potential both for advanced warning of COVID-19 as well as a general system for measuring health via detection of physiological shifts from personal baselines.

During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pool testing is considered across the globe to inform opening strategies and to monitor infection rates after the implementation of interventions. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global efforts to implement pool testing, specifically for COVID-19 screening.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been the dominant sequencing approach to identify genetic variants in recent decades, but most studies focus on variants on the nuclear genome. Whole genome sequencing is also costly and time consuming. Sequencing specifically targeted for mtDNA is commonly used in the diagnostic settings and has lower costs. However, there is a lack of pairwise comparisons between these two sequencing approaches for calling mtDNA variants on a population basis. In this study, we compared WGS and mtDNA-targeted sequencing (targeted-seq) in analyzing mitochondrial DNA from 1499 participants recruited into the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). Our study reveals that targeted-sequencing and WGS have comparable capacity to determine genotypes and to call haplogroups and homoplasmies on mtDNA. However, there exists a large variability in calling heteroplasmies, especially for low-frequency heteroplasmies, which indicates that investigators should be cautious about heteroplasmies acquired from different sequencing methods. Further research is highly desired to improve variant detection methods for mitochondrial DNA.","Asthma|DNA, Mitochondrial|Humans|Mitochondrial DNA|Targeted sequencing|Whole Genome Sequencing|Whole genome sequencing","Chen, Ruoying|Aldred, Micheala A|Xu, Weiling|Zein, Joe|Bazeley, Peter|Comhair, Suzy A A|Meyers, Deborah A|Bleecker, Eugene R|Liu, Chunyu|Erzurum, Serpil C|Hu, Bo|",Mitochondrion,2021,2021-05-01,"Comparative Study|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, the majority of microbiome works dedicated to the public transit air are limited to amplicon sequencing, and our knowledge regarding the functional potentials and the repertoire of resistance genes (i.e. resistome) is limited. Furthermore, current air microbiome investigations on public transit systems are focused on single cities, and a multi-city assessment of the public transit air microbiome will allow a greater understanding of whether and how broad environmental, building, and anthropogenic factors shape the public transit air microbiome in an international scale. Therefore, in this study, the public transit air microbiomes and resistomes of six cities across three continents (Denver, Hong Kong, London, New York City, Oslo, Stockholm) were characterized. City was the sole factor associated with public transit air microbiome differences, with diverse taxa identified as drivers for geography-associated functional potentials, concomitant with geographical differences in species- and strain-level inferred growth profiles. Related bacterial strains differed among cities in genes encoding resistance, transposase, and other functions. Sourcetracking estimated that human skin, soil, and wastewater were major presumptive resistome sources of public transit air, and adjacent public transit surfaces may also be considered presumptive sources. Large proportions of detected resistance genes were co-located with mobile genetic elements including plasmids. Biosynthetic gene clusters and city-unique coding sequences were found in the metagenome-assembled genomes.

There are 25 selenoproteins in humans, and many of them play essential roles in the protection against oxidative stress. Selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, play an important role in the reduction of hydrogen and lipid hydroperoxides, and regulate the redox status of Cys in proteins. Emerging evidence suggests a role for endoplasmic reticulum selenoproteins, such as selenoproteins K, S, and T, in mediating redox homeostasis, protein modifications, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Selenoprotein P, which functions as a carrier of Se to tissues, also participates in regulating cellular reactive oxygen species. Cellular reactive oxygen species are essential for regulating cell growth and proliferation, protein folding, and normal mitochondrial function, but their excess causes cell damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and promotes inflammatory responses. Experimental evidence indicates a role for individual selenoproteins in cardiovascular diseases, primarily by modulating the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species.

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","Adolescent|Adult|Aging|COVID-19|Child|Child, Preschool|Female|Flow Cytometry|Humans|Leukopenia|Lymphocyte Activation|Male|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome|T-Lymphocytes|Young Adult","Vella, Laura A|Giles, Josephine R|Baxter, Amy E|Oldridge, Derek A|Diorio, Caroline|Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia|Alanio, Cécile|Pampena, M Betina|Wu, Jennifer E|Chen, Zeyu|Huang, Yinghui Jane|Anderson, Elizabeth M|Gouma, Sigrid|McNerney, Kevin O|Chase, Julie|Burudpakdee, Chakkapong|Lee, Jessica H|Apostolidis, Sokratis A|Huang, Alexander C|Mathew, Divij|Kuthuru, Oliva|Goodwin, Eileen C|Weirick, Madison E|Bolton, Marcus J|Arevalo, Claudia P|Ramos, Andre|Jasen, C J|Conrey, Peyton E|Sayed, Samir|Giannini, Heather M|D'Andrea, Kurt||Meyer, Nuala J|Behrens, Edward M|Bassiri, Hamid|Hensley, Scott E|Henrickson, Sarah E|Teachey, David T|Betts, Michael R|Wherry, E John",Science immunology,2021,2021-03-02,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

To address this need, we developed the SCENTinel 1.0 test, which rapidly evaluates 3 olfactory functions: detection, intensity, and identification. We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N = 111, 47 ± 13 years old, F = 71%) and normosmic individuals (N = 154, 47 ± 14 years old, F = 74%) as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N = 42, 55 ± 10 years old, F = 67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria compared with only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders. Overall performance on SCENTinel 1.0 predicted belonging to the normosmic group better than identification or detection alone (vs. anosmic: AUC = 0.95, specificity = 0.94). Odor intensity provided the best single-feature predictor to classify normosmic individuals. Among normosmic individuals, 92% met the accuracy criteria at both SCENTinel 1.0 and the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test. SCENTinel 1.0 is a practical test able to discriminate individuals with smell loss and will likely be useful in many clinical situations, including COVID-19 symptom screening.",Adolescent|Adult|Aged|Algorithms|Bayes Theorem|COVID-19|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Odorants|Olfaction Disorders|Young Adult|anosmia|hyposmia|prediction|smell loss|smell test,"Parma, Valentina|Hannum, Mackenzie E|O'Leary, Maureen|Pellegrino, Robert|Rawson, Nancy E|Reed, Danielle R|Dalton, Pamela H",Chemical senses,2021,2021-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Thus, interventions that target this circuitry will have an important impact on MDD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of a novel respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS) technique in the modulation of brain activity and connectivity in women with MDD in response to negative stressful stimuli. Twenty premenopausal women with recurrent MDD in an active episode were included in a cross-over experimental study that included two functional MRI visits within one week, randomized to receive exhalatory- (e-RAVANS) or inhalatory-gated (i-RAVANS) at each visit. Subjects were exposed to a visual stress challenge that preceded and followed RAVANS. A Factorial analysis was used to evaluate the effects of RAVANS on brain activity and connectivity and changes in depressive and anxiety symptomatology post-stress. Compared with i-RAVANS, e-RAVANS was significantly associated with increased activation of subgenual anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices and increased connectivity between hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and from nucleus tractus solitarii to locus coeruleus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Changes in brain activity and connectivity after e-RAVANS were significantly associated with a reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our study suggests exhalatory-gated RAVANS effectively modulates brain circuitries regulating response to negative stress and is associated with significant acute reduction of depressive and anxiety symptomatology in women with recurrent MDD. Findings suggest a potential non-pharmacologic intervention for acute relief of depressive symptomatology in MDD.","Brain|Depression|Depressive Disorder, Major|Female|Humans|Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Major depression|Respiration|Stress response|Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation|Vagus Nerve Stimulation|Vagus nerve|fMRI","Garcia, Ronald G|Cohen, Justine E|Stanford, Arielle D|Gabriel, Aileen|Stowell, Jessica|Aizley, Harlyn|Barbieri, Riccardo|Gitlin, David|Napadow, Vitaly|Goldstein, Jill M",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,2021-10-01,"Journal Article|Randomized Controlled Trial|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Mitigating the COVID-19 transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. We found that shortening by [Formula: see text] of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around [Formula: see text] (or 78 K, [Formula: see text] CI: [66 K , 89 K ]) of the COVID-19 associated deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1, suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission rate.

Studies show that the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-S-1-S) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-S) bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which is clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: <b>1)</b> low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients); <b>2)</b> low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and <b>3)</b> hACE2Tg mice do not develop strong clinical disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in contrast to SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronaviruses is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2-S. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147Tg mouse model in the NOD- <i>scid</i> IL2Rgamma <sup>null</sup> (NSG) background. In this hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed following the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of CD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 model. In addition, the hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations with immunosuppressed conditions. The hCD147Tg-NSG mouse mode can serve as an additional animal model for interrogate whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.",,"Badeti, Saiaditya|Tseng, Hsiang-Chi|Romanienko, Peter|Yehia, Ghassan|Liu, Dongfang",Research square,2021,2021-04-07,Journal Article|Preprint,HL150852,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

While many groups have studied face coverings as personal protective equipment, these respiratory droplets can also serve as a diagnostic fluid to report on health state; surprisingly, studies of face coverings from this perspective are quite limited. Here, we determined the concentration and distribution of aerosolized saliva (<i>via</i> α-amylase levels) captured on various face coverings. Our results showed that α-amylase accumulated on face coverings in a time-dependent way albeit at different levels, <i>e.g</i>., neck gaiters and surgical masks captured about 3-fold more α-amylase than cloth masks and N95 respirators. In addition, the saliva aerosols were primarily detected on the inner layer of multilayered face coverings. We also found that the distribution of salivary droplets on the mask correlated with the morphologies of face coverings as well as their coherence to the face curvature. These findings motivated us to extend this work and build multifunctional sensing strips capable of detecting biomarkers <i>in situ</i> to create ""smart"" masks.

Clean rooms have stringent methods of air-filtration and cleaning to minimize microbial contamination for exoplanetary research and minimize the risk of human pathogens, but they are not sterile. Clean rooms make a selective environment for microorganisms that tolerate such cleaning methods. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the microbial cargo through sequencing and culture-dependent protocols. However, there is not a standardized metagenomic workflow nor analysis pipeline for spaceflight hardware cleanroom samples to identify microbial contamination. Additionally, current identification methods fail to characterize and profile the risk of low-abundance microorganisms. A comprehensive metagenomic framework to characterize microorganisms relevant for planetary protection in multiple cleanroom classifications (from ISO-5 to ISO-8.5) and sample types (surface, filters, and debris collected via vacuum devices) was developed. Fifty-one metagenomic samples from SAF clean rooms were sequenced and analyzed to identify microbes that could potentially survive spaceflight based on their microbial features and whether the microbes expressed any metabolic activity or growth. Additionally, an auxiliary testing was performed to determine the repeatability of our techniques and validate our analyses. We find evidence that JPL clean rooms carry microbes with attributes that may be problematic in space missions for their documented ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as psychrophilia and ability to form biofilms, spore-forming capacity, radiation resistance, and desiccation resistance. Samples from ISO-5 standard had lower microbial diversity than those conforming to ISO-6 or higher filters but still carried a measurable microbial load. Although the extensive cleaning processes limit the number of microbes capable of withstanding clean room condition, it is important to quantify thresholds and detect organisms that can inform ongoing Planetary Protection goals, provide a biological baseline for assembly facilities, and guide future mission planning.

The mesmerizing properties of MOFs, especially the extensive and tunable porosity and chemical selectivity, also make them an excellent candidate class as chemo-sensory materials. Moreover, MOF-based sensors have attracted considerable attention in the past decade. Recent literature reviews focused on the progress of MOF-based electronic sensors and luminescent MOF sensors, while sensors exploiting the dielectric properties (refractive index) of MOFs were also demonstrated and discussed very recently. The motivation of this report is to provide, for the first time, a general review on such MOF sensors with a particular focus on miniature optical fiber (OF) based MOF sensors and to demonstrate the promising potential of MOFs as dielectric coatings on OF for highly sensitive chemical sensing. The fundamental principle of OF-MOF sensors relies on the tunability of the refractive index of a MOF, which is dependent on the amount and type of adsorbed guest molecules in the MOF pores.

These particles, however, are unstable in physiological salt solutions due to their formation through electrostatic interactions. In the present study, a method was developed to covalently crosslink chitosan in the core of the DSCS NP with a short chain dicarboxylic acid (succinate), while leaving the outer shell of the particle untouched. The crosslinked particles, XDSCS NPs, are stable in NaCl solutions up to 3 M. XDSCS NPs were able to incorporate heparin-binding proteins (VEGF and SDF-1α) rapidly and efficiently, and maintain the full biological activity of the proteins. The incorporated proteins were not released from the particles after a 14-day incubation period at 37 °C in PBS, but retained the same activity as those stored at 4 °C. When aerosolized for delivery to the lungs of rats, XDSCS NP-incorporated SDF-1α showed a ∼17-fold greater retention time compared to that of free protein. These properties suggest that XDSCS NPs could be beneficial for the delivery of therapeutic heparin-binding proteins to achieve sustained in vivo effects.",Animals|Carrier Proteins|Chitosan|Dextran Sulfate|Drug Carriers|Drug delivery|Heparin|Heparin-binding proteins|Nanoparticles|Polysaccharide nanoparticles|Rats,"Guarino, Victoria A|Blau, Adam|Alvarenga, Jack|Loscalzo, Joseph|Zhang, Ying-Yi",International journal of pharmaceutics,2021,2021-12-15,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In healthy individuals who undergo right heart catheterisation, the average pulmonary artery systolic pressure ranges from 17 mm Hg to 25 mm Hg; on echocardiography, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of more than 30 mm Hg is outside the normal range for most healthy individuals. Increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (>30 mm Hg) is reported on more than 40% of clinically indicated echocardiograms, often in the presence of metabolic and cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and is associated with a 5-year mortality of 25-40%. However, current guidelines do not sufficiently highlight risk and risk-reduction approaches for the sizable patient population with elevated pulmonary artery pressure who do not have underlying severe pulmonary vascular disease such as pulmonary arterial hypertension. Increased awareness of this frequently reported high-risk echocardiographic finding, and multidisciplinary risk-reduction approaches for patients with metabolic and cardiopulmonary comorbidities and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, are urgently needed.","Blood Pressure|Echocardiography|Echocardiography, Doppler|Humans|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Pulmonary Artery","Jankowich, Matthew|Maron, Bradley A|Choudhary, Gaurav",The Lancet.

Highly variable sputum eosinophil percentages are associated with greater lung function loss than persistently elevated eosinophil percentages, but elevated neutrophils are linked to more severe asthma.<b>Objectives:</b> To examine sputum granulocyte stability or variability longitudinally and associations with important clinical characteristics.<b>Methods:</b> The SARP III (Severe Asthma Research Program III) cohort underwent comprehensive phenotype characterization at baseline and annually over 3 years. Adult subjects with acceptable sputum levels were assigned to one of three longitudinal sputum groups: eosinophils predominantly <2%, eosinophils predominantly ≥2%, or highly variable eosinophil percentages (>2 SDs determined from independent, repeated baseline eosinophil percentages).

Therefore, the development of a sensing platform where the gold nanorod morphology (i.e., aspect ratio) is modulated in response to an analyte holds promise in achieving ultralow detection limits. Here, we use a dithiol peptide as an enzyme substrate during nanorod growth. The sensing mechanism is enabled by the substrate design, where the dithiol peptide contains an enzyme cleavage site in-between cysteine amino acids. When cleaved, the peptide dramatically impacts gold nanorod growth and the resulting optical properties. We demonstrate that the optical response can be correlated with enzyme concentration and achieve a 45 pM limit of detection. Furthermore, we extend this sensing platform to colorimetrically detect tumor-associated inhibitors in a biologically relevant medium. Overall, these results present a subnanomolar method to detect proteases that are critical biomarkers found in cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders.",Animals|Aprotinin|Biomarkers|Cattle|Colorimetry|Enzyme Assays|Gold|Humans|Limit of Detection|Nanotubes|Peptides|Proof of Concept Study|Proteolysis|Swine|Trypsin|Trypsin Inhibitors|biomarkers|biosensing|enzyme activity|gold nanorods|peptides|proteolysis,"Creyer, Matthew N|Jin, Zhicheng|Moore, Colman|Yim, Wonjun|Zhou, Jiajing|Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,2021-09-29,Journal Article,DE031114,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

From The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study: Coronavirus Disease 2019 Registry Investigator Group.,"At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, medications repurposed for management of coronavirus disease 2019 were used in the absence of clinical trial evidence. To describe the variation and evolution in use of repurposed medications for coronavirus disease 2019. Observational cohort study of adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between February 15, 2020, and April 12, 2021, across 76 United States and international hospitals within the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry. Hospital variation was quantified using multivariable adjusted random effects logistic regression models and unsupervised clustering. Repurposed medications included antivirals, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, immunomodulators, and therapeutic dose anticoagulants. Among 7,069 adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, 1,979 (28%) received antivirals, 2,876 (41%) received corticosteroids, 1,779 (25%) received hydroxychloroquine, 620 (9%) received immunomodulators, and 2,154 (31%) received therapeutic dose anticoagulants. Contribution of hospital site to risk-adjusted variation was 46% for antivirals, 30% for corticosteroids, 48% for hydroxychloroquine, 46% for immunomodulators, and 52% for therapeutic dose anticoagulants. Compared with the early pandemic, the later pandemic practice phenotypes converged with increased use of antivirals (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.40-4.10) and corticosteroids (odds ratio, 5.43; 95% CI, 4.23-6.97), with decreased use of hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.04) and immunomodulators (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34-0.70). There was no clinically significant change in the use of therapeutic dose anticoagulants (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02). There were no differences in risk-adjusted mortality between hospitals with high rates of repurposed medication use compared with hospitals with low rates of use. Hospital variation in the use of repurposed medications varied widely across hospitals early in the pandemic and later converged with the emergence of randomized clinical trials.

Approaches to this task have been varied, relying on differing sequencing methods and computational analyses. We used a novel computation workflow based on amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 spike domains in order to track viral populations in wastewater. As part of this workflow, we developed a program, SAM Refiner, that has a variety of outputs, including novel variant reporting as well as functions designed to remove polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generated chimeric sequences. With these methods, we were able to track viral population dynamics over time.

Here, we study if coupling high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes with variant analysis can resolve strains from local transmission that have identical consensus genome. We analyzed 24 samples collected over four days in January 2020 at a large university in the US. We amplified complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genomic segments followed by Illumina sequencing. We identified consensus complete HA and NA segments using BLASTn and performed variant analysis on strains whose HA and NA segments were 100% similar. Twelve of the 24 samples were PCR positive, and we detected complete HA and/or NA segments by de novo assembly in 83.33% (10/12) of them. Similarity and phylogenetic analysis showed that 70% (7/10) of the strains were distinct while the remaining 30% had identical consensus sequences. These three samples also had IAV and IBV co-infection. However, subsequent variant analysis showed that they had distinct variant profiles. While the IAV HA of one sample had no variant, another had a T663C mutation and another had both C1379T and C1589A. In this study, we showed that HTS coupled with variant analysis of only HA and NA genes can help resolve variants that are closely related. We also provide evidence that during a short time period in the 2019-2020 season, co-infection of IAV and IBV occurred on the university campus and both 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 WHO recommended H1N1 vaccine strains were co-circulating.","Arizona|Coinfection|Consensus Sequence|Genetic Variation|HTS|Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus|Hemagglutinins|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Humans|Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype|Influenza virus|Influenza, Human|Local transmission|Neuraminidase|Orthomyxoviridae|Phylogeny|Seasons|Variant analysis","Faleye, Temitope O C|Adams, Deborah|Adhikari, Sangeet|Sandrolini, Helen|Halden, Rolf U|Varsani, Arvind|Scotch, Matthew",BMC infectious diseases,2021,2021-08-13,Journal Article,LM013129,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.","Antibodies, Viral|Binding Sites|Breast milk|COVID-19|Dried Blood Spot Testing|Humans|Microsampling|Seroepidemiology|Vaccination","Datta, Pratik|Ukey, Rahul|Bruiners, Natalie|Honnen, William|Carayannopoulos, Mary O|Reichman, Charles|Choudhary, Alok|Onyuka, Alberta|Handler, Deborah|Guerrini, Valentina|Mishra, Pankaj K|Dewald, Hannah K|Lardizabal, Alfred|Lederer, Leeba|Leiser, Aliza L|Hussain, Sabiha|Jagpal, Sugeet K|Radbel, Jared|Bhowmick, Tanaya|Horton, Daniel B|Barrett, Emily S|Xie, Yingda L|Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, Patricia|Weiss, Stanley H|Woortman, Melissa|Parmar, Heta|Roy, Jason|Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria|Blaser, Martin J|Carson, Jeffrey L|Panettieri, Reynold A|Libutti, Steven K|Raymond, Henry F|Pinter, Abraham|Gennaro, Maria Laura",Journal of immunological methods,2021,2021-12-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HD105619,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973 SNVs, of which 548 were ""novel"" SNVs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17<sup>th</sup> June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However, between 17<sup>th</sup> of June 2020 and 20<sup>th</sup> November 2020, almost half of the novel SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.",COVID-19|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|High-throughput sequencing|Humans|Pandemics|SARS-CoV-2|Surveillance|Wastewater|Wastewater-based epidemiology,"Fontenele, Rafaela S|Kraberger, Simona|Hadfield, James|Driver, Erin M|Bowes, Devin|Holland, LaRinda A|Faleye, Temitope O C|Adhikari, Sangeet|Kumar, Rahul|Inchausti, Rosa|Holmes, Wydale K|Deitrick, Stephanie|Brown, Philip|Duty, Darrell|Smith, Ted|Bhatnagar, Aruni|Yeager, Ray A|Holm, Rochelle H|von Reitzenstein, Natalia Hoogesteijn|Wheeler, Elliott|Dixon, Kevin|Constantine, Tim|Wilson, Melissa A|Lim, Efrem S|Jiang, Xiaofang|Halden, Rolf U|Scotch, Matthew|Varsani, Arvind",Water research,2021,2021-10-15,Journal Article,LM013129,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Wastewater

A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano-HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano-HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano-IC<sub>50</sub> for aspirin, Y-27632, and eptifibatide.

Kawasaki disease (KD) shares several clinical features with MIS-C, which prompted the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a mainstay therapy for KD. Both diseases share a robust activation of the innate immune system, including the IL-1 signaling pathway, and IL-1 blockade has been used for the treatment of both MIS-C and KD. The mechanism of action of IVIG in these 2 diseases and the cellular source of IL-1β have not been defined.METHODSThe effects of IVIG on peripheral blood leukocyte populations from patients with MIS-C and KD were examined using flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and live-cell imaging.RESULTSCirculating neutrophils were highly activated in patients with KD and MIS-C and were a major source of IL-1β. Following IVIG treatment, activated IL-1β+ neutrophils were reduced in the circulation. In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3K and NADPH oxidase, but independently of caspase activation.CONCLUSIONSActivated neutrophils expressing IL-1β can be targeted by IVIG, supporting its use in both KD and MIS-C to ameliorate inflammation.FUNDINGPatient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; NIH; American Asthma Foundation; American Heart Association; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIGMS; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation.","Apoptosis|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|Cell Death|Cell Lineage|Child|Child, Preschool|Fas Ligand Protein|Female|Humans|Immunoglobulins, Intravenous|Infant|Innate immunity|Interleukin-1beta|Leukocyte Count|Male|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Neutrophil Activation|Neutrophils|Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome","Zhu, Yanfang P|Shamie, Isaac|Lee, Jamie C|Nowell, Cameron J|Peng, Weiqi|Angulo, Shiela|Le, Linh Nn|Liu, Yushan|Miao, Huilai|Xiong, Hainan|Pena, Cathleen J|Moreno, Elizabeth|Griffis, Eric|Labou, Stephanie G|Franco, Alessandra|Broderick, Lori|Hoffman, Hal M|Shimizu, Chisato|Lewis, Nathan E|Kanegaye, John T|Tremoulet, Adriana H|Burns, Jane C|Croker, Ben A|",The Journal of clinical investigation,2021,2021-10-15,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HD105590,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Impaired endothelial glycolysis has been associated with various vascular pathobiologies, including impaired angiogenesis and atherogenesis. IFN-γ (interferon-γ)-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes have been identified as the predominant pathological cell subsets in human atherosclerotic plaques. Although the immunologic consequences of these cells have been extensively evaluated, their IFN-γ-mediated metabolic effects on endothelial cells remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolic consequences of the T-lymphocyte cytokine, IFN-γ, on human coronary artery endothelial cells. The metabolic effects of IFN-γ on primary human coronary artery endothelial cells were assessed by unbiased transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses combined with real-time extracellular flux analyses and molecular mechanistic studies. Cellular phenotypic correlations were made by measuring altered endothelial intracellular cGMP content, wound-healing capacity, and adhesion molecule expression. IFN-γ exposure inhibited basal glycolysis of quiescent primary human coronary artery endothelial cells by 20% through the global transcriptional suppression of glycolytic enzymes resulting from decreased basal HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) nuclear availability in normoxia. The decrease in HIF1α activity was a consequence of IFN-γ-induced tryptophan catabolism resulting in ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator)/HIF1β sequestration by the kynurenine-activated AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor). In addition, IFN-γ resulted in a 23% depletion of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in human coronary artery endothelial cells. This altered glucose metabolism was met with concomitant activation of fatty acid oxidation, which augmented its contribution to intracellular ATP balance by >20%. These metabolic derangements were associated with adverse endothelial phenotypic changes, including decreased basal intracellular cGMP, impaired endothelial migration, and a switch to a proinflammatory state. IFN-γ impairs endothelial glucose metabolism by altered tryptophan catabolism destabilizing HIF1, depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and results in a metabolic shift toward increased fatty acid oxidation. This work suggests a novel mechanistic basis for pathological T lymphocyte-endothelial interactions in atherosclerosis mediated by IFN-γ, linking endothelial glucose, tryptophan, and fatty acid metabolism with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide balance and ATP generation and their adverse endothelial functional consequences.","Biomarkers|Cell Movement|Cell Proliferation|Cells, Cultured|Coronary Vessels|Endothelial Cells|Energy Metabolism|Fatty Acids|Gene Expression Regulation|Glucose|Glycolysis|Humans|Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit|Interferon-gamma|Kynurenine|Oxidation-Reduction|Protein Binding|Signal Transduction|Tryptophan|coronary artery|endothelium|fatty acid oxidation|glycolysis|interferon-γ|metabolism|tryptophan","Lee, Laurel Yong-Hwa|Oldham, William M|He, Huamei|Wang, Ruisheng|Mulhern, Ryan|Handy, Diane E|Loscalzo, Joseph",Circulation,2021,2021-11-16,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide (β ~ 8.99 ∗ ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample collection frequency from weekly to daily. Coupling simpler and faster detection technology with more frequent sampling has the potential to improve the predictive potential of using WBS of SARS-CoV-2 for early detection of the onset of COVID-19.","COVID-19|Concentration|Detection|Humans|Pandemics|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Sampling|Wastewater|Wastewater based surveillance","Sharkey, Mark E|Kumar, Naresh|Mantero, Alejandro M A|Babler, Kristina M|Boone, Melinda M|Cardentey, Yoslayma|Cortizas, Elena M|Grills, George S|Herrin, James|Kemper, Jenny M|Kenney, Richard|Kobetz, Erin|Laine, Jennifer|Lamar, Walter E|Mader, Christopher C|Mason, Christopher E|Quintero, Anda Z|Reding, Brian D|Roca, Matthew A|Ryon, Krista|Solle, Natasha Schaefer|Schürer, Stephan C|Shukla, Bhavarth|Stevenson, Mario|Stone, Thomas|Tallon, John J|Venkatapuram, Sreeharsha S|Vidovic, Dusica|Williams, Sion L|Young, Benjamin|Solo-Gabriele, Helena M",The Science of the total environment,2021,2021-12-01,Journal Article,DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Co-application of QX-314 with TRPV1 or TRPA1 activators can silence nociceptors. In this study, we describe BW-031, a novel more potent cationic sodium channel inhibitor, and test whether its application alone can inhibit pain associated with tissue inflammation and whether this strategy can also inhibit cough. We tested the ability of BW-031 to inhibit pain in three models of tissue inflammation:- inflammation in rat paws produced by complete Freund's adjuvant or by surgical incision and a mouse ultraviolet (UV) burn model. We tested the ability of BW-031 to inhibit cough induced by inhalation of dilute citric acid in guinea pigs. BW-031 inhibited Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7 and Na<sub>v</sub> 1.1 channels with approximately sixfold greater potency than QX-314 when introduced inside cells. BW-031 inhibited inflammatory pain in all three models tested, producing more effective and longer-lasting inhibition of pain than QX-314 in the mouse UV burn model. BW-031 was effective in reducing cough counts by 78%-90% when applied intratracheally under isoflurane anaesthesia or by aerosol inhalation in guinea pigs with airway inflammation produced by ovalbumin sensitization. BW-031 is a novel cationic sodium channel inhibitor that can be applied locally as a single agent to inhibit inflammatory pain.

We collected 48 samples from 13 sites in three municipalities between 18 June and 1 October 2020, and filtered (175 mL each; 0.45 µm pore size) and extracted RNA from the filter-trapped solids. The RNA was converted to cDNA and processed through two workflows (Sanger sequencing (SSW) and long-read Illumina sequencing (LRISW)) each including a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay. We subjected the ~350 bp amplicon from SSW to Sanger sequencing and the ~1900-2400 bp amplicon from LRISW to Illumina sequencing. We identified EV contigs from 11 of the 13 sites and 41.67% (20/48) of screened samples.

However, the SSW only detected the five Enterovirus C types.

33566573,PMC9053107,doi:10.1021/acsami.0c21040,A Portable Magnetic Particle Spectrometer for Future Rapid and Wash-Free Bioassays.,"Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for more accessible routine diagnostics for patients with respect to high accuracy, ease of use, and low cost. However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.","Biological Assay|COVID-19|Humans|Hydrodynamics|Influenza, Human|Magnetic Phenomena|Magnetite Nanoparticles|Particle Size|Smartphone|Streptavidin|Surface Properties|bioassay|magnetic particle spectrometer|point-of-care|portable|wash-free","Wu, Kai|Chugh, Vinit Kumar|di Girolamo, Arturo|Liu, Jinming|Saha, Renata|Su, Diqing|Krishna, Venkatramana D|Nair, Abilash|Davies, Will|Wang, Yongqiang Andrew|Cheeran, Maxim C-J|Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,2021-02-24,Journal Article,DE030832,,,,,,R42,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks. This review describes the current state of the art for research of LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as its implications for other pathogens and testing. The authors represent the global LAMP (gLAMP) Consortium, an international research collective, which has regularly met to share their experiences on LAMP deployment and best practices; sections are devoted to all aspects of LAMP testing, including preanalytic sample processing, target amplification, and amplicon detection, then the hardware and software required for deployment are discussed, and finally, a summary of the current regulatory landscape is provided. Included as well are a series of first-person accounts of LAMP method development and deployment. The final discussion section provides the reader with a distillation of the most validated testing methods and their paths to implementation. This review also aims to provide practical information and insight for a range of audiences: for a research audience, to help accelerate research through sharing of best practices; for an implementation audience, to help get testing up and running quickly; and for a public health, clinical, and policy audience, to help convey the breadth of the effect that LAMP methods have to offer.","COVID-19|COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing|Humans|Molecular Diagnostic Techniques|Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques|Pandemics|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2","Moore, Keith J M|Cahill, Jeremy|Aidelberg, Guy|Aronoff, Rachel|Bektaş, Ali|Bezdan, Daniela|Butler, Daniel J|Chittur, Sridar V|Codyre, Martin|Federici, Fernan|Tanner, Nathan A|Tighe, Scott W|True, Randy|Ware, Sarah B|Wyllie, Anne L|Afshin, Evan E|Bendesky, Andres|Chang, Connie B|Dela Rosa, Richard|Elhaik, Eran|Erickson, David|Goldsborough, Andrew S|Grills, George|Hadasch, Kathrin|Hayden, Andrew|Her, Seong-Young|Karl, Julie A|Kim, Chang Hee|Kriegel, Alison J|Kunstman, Thomas|Landau, Zeph|Land, Kevin|Langhorst, Bradley W|Lindner, Ariel B|Mayer, Benjamin E|McLaughlin, Lee A|McLaughlin, Matthew T|Molloy, Jenny|Mozsary, Christopher|Nadler, Jerry L|D'Silva, Melinee|Ng, David|O'Connor, David H|Ongerth, Jerry E|Osuolale, Olayinka|Pinharanda, Ana|Plenker, Dennis|Ranjan, Ravi|Rosbash, Michael|Rotem, Assaf|Segarra, Jacob|Schürer, Stephan|Sherrill-Mix, Scott|Solo-Gabriele, Helena|To, Shaina|Vogt, Merly C|Yu, Albert D|Mason, Christopher E|",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2021,2021-09-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

Here, myectomy tissue from patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure is analyzed using RNA-Seq, and the results are used to develop individualized protein-protein interaction networks. From this approach, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is distinguished from dilated cardiomyopathy based on the protein-protein interaction network pattern. Within the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cohort, the patient-specific networks are variable in complexity, and enriched for 30 endophenotypes. The cardiac Janus kinase 2-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3-collagen 4A2 (JAK2-STAT3-COL4A2) expression profile informed by the networks was able to discriminate two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with extreme fibrosis phenotypes. Patient-specific network features also associate with other important hypertrophic cardiomyopathy clinical phenotypes. These proof-of-concept findings introduce personalized protein-protein interaction networks (reticulotypes) for characterizing patient-specific pathobiology, thereby offering a direct strategy for advancing precision medicine.","Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic|Case-Control Studies|Cohort Studies|Endophenotypes|Fibrosis|Gene Regulatory Networks|Heart Failure|Humans|Phenotype|Precision Medicine|Protein Interaction Maps|Signal Transduction|Transcriptome","Maron, Bradley A|Wang, Rui-Sheng|Shevtsov, Sergei|Drakos, Stavros G|Arons, Elena|Wever-Pinzon, Omar|Huggins, Gordon S|Samokhin, Andriy O|Oldham, William M|Aguib, Yasmine|Yacoub, Magdi H|Rowin, Ethan J|Maron, Barry J|Maron, Martin S|Loscalzo, Joseph",Nature communications,2021,2021-02-08,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

This 'innocent bystander' tissue injury arises in dysregulated hyperinflammatory states from neutrophil functions and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) intended to kill pathogens, but injure cells instead, causing MOF. Insufficiency of prior therapeutic approaches suggest need to identify dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) and induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown and clearance. We hypothesized that neutrophils expressing the pro-survival dual endothelin-1/signal peptide receptor, DEspR, are apoptosis-resistant just like DEspR+ cancer cells, hence comprise a consequential pathogenic neutrophil-subset in ARDS and COVID19-ARDS. Here, we report correlation of circulating DEspR+CD11b+ activated neutrophils (DESpR+actNs) and NETosing-neutrophils with severity in ARDS and in COVID19-ARDS, increased DEspR+ neutrophils and monocytes in post-mortem ARDS-patient lung sections, and neutrophil DEspR/ET1 receptor/ligand autocrine loops in severe COVID19.

Where the pandemic has been controlled, extremely high rates of diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have proven critical, enabling isolation of cases and contact tracing. Recently, diagnostic testing has been supplemented with wastewater measures to evaluate the degree to which communities have infections. Whereas much testing has been done through traditional, centralized, clinical, or environmental laboratory methods, point-of-care testing has proven successful in reducing time to result. As the pandemic progresses and becomes more broadly distributed, further decentralization of diagnostic testing will be helpful to mitigate its spread. This will be particularly both challenging and critical in settings with limited resources due to lack of medical infrastructure and expertise as well as requirements to return results quickly. In this article, we validate the tiny isothermal nucleic acid quantification system (TINY) and a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assay for the point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and also for in-the-field, point-of-collection surveillance of wastewater. The TINY system is portable and designed for use in settings with limited resources. It can be powered by electrical, solar, or thermal energy and is robust against interruptions in services. These applied testing examples demonstrate that this novel detection platform is a simpler procedure than reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and moreover, this TINY instrument and LAMP assay combination has the potential to effectively provide both point-of-care diagnosis of individuals and point-of-collection environmental surveillance using wastewater.","COVID-19|Humans|Pandemics|Point-of-Care Systems|RNA, Viral|SARS-CoV-2","Mozsary, Christopher|McCloskey, Duncan|Babler, Kristina M|Boza, Juan|Butler, Daniel|Currall, Benjamin|Williams, Sion|Wiley, Anne|Afshin, Evan E|Grills, George S|Sharkey, Mark E|Premsrirut, Prem|Solo-Gabriele, Helena|Cardentey, Yoslayma|Erickson, David|Mason, Christopher E",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2021,2021-09-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053941,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

34591794,PMC8663569,doi:10.1172/jci.insight.149945,Machine learning implicates the IL-18 signaling axis in severe asthma.,"Asthma is a common disease with profoundly variable natural history and patient morbidity. Heterogeneity has long been appreciated, and much work has focused on identifying subgroups of patients with similar pathobiological underpinnings. Previous studies of the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked gene expression changes to specific clinical and physiologic characteristics. While invaluable for hypothesis generation, these data include extensive candidate gene lists that complicate target identification and validation. In this analysis, we performed unsupervised clustering of the SARP cohort using bronchial epithelial cell gene expression data, identifying a transcriptional signature for participants suffering exacerbation-prone asthma with impaired lung function. Clinically, participants in this asthma cluster exhibited a mixed inflammatory process and bore transcriptional hallmarks of NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation, despite high corticosteroid exposure. Using supervised machine learning, we found a set of 31 genes that classified patients with high accuracy and could reconstitute clinical and transcriptional hallmarks of our patient clustering in an external cohort. Of these genes, IL18R1 (IL-18 Receptor 1) negatively associated with lung function and was highly expressed in the most severe patient cluster. We validated IL18R1 protein expression in lung tissue and identified downstream NF-κB and AP-1 activity, supporting IL-18 signaling in severe asthma pathogenesis and highlighting this approach for gene and pathway discovery.",Adult|Asthma|Bioinformatics|Case-Control Studies|Female|Humans|Immunology|Interleukin-18|Machine Learning|Male|Molecular pathology|Pulmonology,"Camiolo, Matthew J|Zhou, Xiuxia|Wei, Qi|Trejo Bittar, Humberto E|Kaminski, Naftali|Ray, Anuradha|Wenzel, Sally E",JCI insight,2021,2021-11-08,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, nucleic acids, and so forth. Herein, we report a modified version of the MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). We first demonstrated the performance of this MPS system for bioassay-related applications. Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a model, we have achieved a detection limit of 125 nM (equal to 5 pmole) for detecting spike protein molecules in the liquid phase. In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration-dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin were also investigated. Results show that by using a lower concentration/ amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to a lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentration-response indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.",,"Chugh, Vinit Kumar|Wu, Kai|Krishna, Venkatramana D|di Girolamo, Arturo|Bloom, Robert P|Wang, Yongqiang Andrew|Saha, Renata|Liang, Shuang|Cheeran, Maxim C-J|Wang, Jian-Ping","The journal of physical chemistry.

Previous studies from our group have shown that SP-A mediates eosinophil activities, including degranulation and apoptosis. In order to identify potential binding partners on eosinophils for SP-A, eosinophil lysates were subjected to SP-A pull-down and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. We identified one membrane-bound protein, myeloid-associated differentiation marker (MYADM), as a candidate SP-A binding partner. Blocking MYADM on mouse and human eosinophils ex vivo prevented SP-A from inducing apoptosis; blocking MYADM in vivo led to increased persistence of eosinophilia and airway hyper-responsiveness in an ovalbumin (OVA) allergy model and increased airways resistance and mucus production in a house dust mite (HDM) asthma model. Examination of a subset of participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort revealed a significant association between epithelial expression of MYADM in asthma patients and parameters of airway inflammation, including: peripheral blood eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and the number of exacerbations in the past 12 months. Taken together, our studies provide the first evidence of MYADM as a novel SP-A-associated protein that is necessary for SP-A to induce eosinophil apoptosis and we bring to light the potential importance of this previously unrecognized transmembrane protein in patients with asthma.","Adult|Animals|Asthma|Chromatography, Liquid|Disease Models, Animal|Eosinophils|Female|Humans|Male|Mice|Middle Aged|Myelin and Lymphocyte-Associated Proteolipid Proteins|Patient Acuity|Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A|Pyroglyphidae|Tandem Mass Spectrometry|Young Adult","Dy, Alane Blythe C|Langlais, Paul R|Barker, Natalie K|Addison, Kenneth J|Tanyaratsrisakul, Sasipa|Boitano, Scott|Christenson, Stephanie A|Kraft, Monica|Meyers, Deborah|Bleecker, Eugene R|Li, Xingnan|Ledford, Julie G",Scientific reports,2021,2021-12-03,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In particular, OMP, a small cytoplasmic protein, marks mature ORNs and is also expressed in the neurons of other nasal chemosensory systems: the vomeronasal organ, the septal organ of Masera, and the Grueneberg ganglion. While its expression pattern was more easily established, OMP's function remained relatively vague. To date, most of the work to understand OMP's role has been done using mice lacking OMP. This mostly phenomenological work has shown that OMP is involved in sharpening the odorant response profile and in quickening odorant response kinetics of ORNs and that it contributes to targeting of ORN axons to the olfactory bulb to refine the glomerular response map. Increasing evidence shows that OMP acts at the early stages of olfactory transduction by modulating the kinetics of cAMP, the second messenger of olfactory transduction. However, how this occurs at a mechanistic level is not understood, and it might also not be the only mechanism underlying all the changes observed in mice lacking OMP. Recently, OMP has been detected outside the nose, including the brain and other organs. Although no obvious logic has become apparent regarding the underlying commonality between nasal and extranasal expression of OMP, a broader approach to diverse cellular systems might help unravel OMP's functions and mechanisms of action inside and outside the nose.",Animals|Olfactory Marker Protein|Olfactory Receptor Neurons|Olfactory bulb|Olfactory marker protein|Olfactory receptor neurons|Signal transduction|Vertebrates,"Dibattista, Michele|Al Koborssy, Dolly|Genovese, Federica|Reisert, Johannes",Cell and tissue research,2021,2021-01-01,Journal Article|Review,DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Whole blood mRNA transcriptome profiles of 13 neonates with HLHS before and after their first palliative surgery were analyzed to determine differentially expressed genes and pathways. The median age and weight at surgery were 4 days and 3.2 kg, respectively. Of the 13 patients, 8 developed LCOS. There was no significant difference between CPB, aortic cross clamp, deep hypothermic cardiac arrest times between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not. Upon comparing differential gene expression profiles between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not in pre-operative samples, 1 gene was up-regulated and 13 were down regulated. In the post-operative samples, 4 genes were up-regulated, and 4 genes were down regulated when patients that develop LCOS were compared to those that do not. When comparing post-operative samples to pre-operative samples in the patients that do not develop LCOS, 1484 genes were up-regulated, and 1388 genes were down regulated; while patients that developed LCOS had 2423 up-regulated genes, and 2414 down regulated genes for the same pre to post-operative comparison. Pathway analysis revealed differential regulation of inflammatory pathways (IL signaling, PDGF, NOTCH1, NGF, GPCR) and metabolic pathways (heme metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, protein metabolism including amino acid and derivatives, fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain). By identifying altered transcriptome profiles related to inflammation and metabolism in neonates with HLHS who develop LCOS after CPB, this study opens for exploration novel pathways and potential therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.","Cardiac Surgical Procedures|Cardiopulmonary Bypass|Female|Humans|Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome|Infant, Newborn|Male|Metabolome|Prospective Studies|Transcriptome","Jain, Parag N|Robertson, Matthew|Lasa, Javier J|Shekerdemian, Lara|Guffey, Danielle|Zhang, Yuhao|Lingappan, Krithika|Checchia, Paul|Coarfa, Cristian",Scientific reports,2021,2021-03-02,"Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Observational Study|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies<sup>4</sup>. Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant<sup>5</sup>), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526. Although SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region, its growth subsequently slowed concurrently with the rise of B.1.1.7 and ensuing variants.","Antibodies, Neutralizing|COVID-19|Humans|Mutation|New York|Phylogeny|Phylogeography|Prevalence|SARS-CoV-2|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|United States","Annavajhala, Medini K|Mohri, Hiroshi|Wang, Pengfei|Nair, Manoj|Zucker, Jason E|Sheng, Zizhang|Gomez-Simmonds, Angela|Kelley, Anne L|Tagliavia, Maya|Huang, Yaoxing|Bedford, Trevor|Ho, David D|Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",Nature,2021,2021-09-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DA053949,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Wastewater

However, most existing exosome-based analytical sensing methods struggle to achieve high sensitivity and high selectivity simultaneously. In this work, we present an electrochemical micro-aptasensor for the highly sensitive detection of exosomes by integrating a micropatterned electrochemical aptasensor and a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) signal amplification method. Specifically, exosomes are enriched on CD63 aptamer-functionalized electrodes and then recognized by HCR products with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) attached using EpCAM aptamers as bridges. Subsequently, the current signal that is generated through the enzyme reaction between the HRP enzyme and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> directly correlates to the amount of bound HRP on the HCR products and thus to the number of target exosomes. By introducing anti-EpCAM aptamers, micro-aptasensors can detect cancerous exosomes with high specificity. Due to the micropatterned electrodes and HCR dual-amplification strategy, the micro-aptasensors achieve a linear detection response for a wide range of exosome concentrations from 2.5×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>7</sup> exosomes/mL, with a detection limit of 5×10<sup>2</sup> exosomes/mL.

We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020, collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches.

We first studied the non-specific effects of planned seasonal influenza vaccines on breath metabolites in healthy subjects after receiving the immunization. We then investigated changes in breath content from hospitalized patients with flu-like symptoms and confirmed upper respiratory viral infection. The exhaled breath was sampled using a custom-made breath condenser, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled to quadruplole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-qTOF). All metabolomic data was analysed using both targeted and untargeted approaches to detect specific known biomarkers from inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as new molecules associated with specific infections. We were able to find clear differences between breath samples collected before and after flu vaccine administration, together with potential biomarkers that are related to inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. Moreover, we were also able to discriminate samples from patients with flu-related symptoms that were diagnosed with confirmatory respiratory viral panels (RVPs).

However, the wide variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research. Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and cross-validated resource for epigenetics research from the FDA's Epigenomics Quality Control Group. Each sample is processed in multiple replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), enzymatic deamination method (EMSeq), targeted methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), single-molecule long-read nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 850k Illumina methylation arrays. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, bwa-meth, and BitMapperBS), we find overall high concordance between assays, but also differences in efficiency of read mapping, CpG capture, coverage, and platform performance, and variable performance across 26 microarray normalization algorithms. The data provided herein can guide the use of these DNA reference materials in epigenomics research, as well as provide best practices for experimental design in future studies.

Diagnosing viral infections often requires invasive sampling, and interpretation often requires specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we test the hypothesis that a breath test could diagnose influenza and rhinovirus infections using an in vitro model of the human airway. Cultured primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were infected with either influenza A H1N1 or rhinovirus 1B and compared with healthy control cells. Headspace volatile metabolite measurements of cell cultures were made at 12-hour time points postinfection using a thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Based on 54 compounds, statistical models distinguished volatile organic compound profiles of influenza- and rhinovirus-infected cells from healthy counterparts. Area under the curve values were 0.94 for influenza, 0.90 for rhinovirus, and 0.75 for controls. Regression analysis predicted how many hours prior cells became infected with a root mean square error of 6.35 hours for influenza- and 3.32 hours for rhinovirus-infected cells. Volatile biomarkers released by bronchial epithelial cells could not only be used to diagnose whether cells were infected, but also the timing of infection. Our model supports the hypothesis that a breath test could serve to diagnose viral infections.","Biomarkers|Communicable Diseases|Humans|Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype|Influenza, Human|Rhinovirus|VOCs|Volatile Organic Compounds|diagnostics|influenza|mass spectrometry|rhinovirus","McCartney, Mitchell M|Linderholm, Angela L|Yamaguchi, Mei S|Falcon, Alexandria K|Harper, Richart W|Thompson, George R|Ebeler, Susan E|Kenyon, Nicholas J|Davis, Cristina E|Schivo, Michael",The Journal of infectious diseases,2021,2021-11-22,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",TR003795,,,,,,U18,False,RADx-rad,SCENT

Current centralized image sharing frameworks become dysfunctional if any part of the framework fails. Existing decentralized image sharing frameworks do not store the images on the blockchain, thus the data themselves are not highly available, immutable, and provable. Meanwhile, storing images on the blockchain provides availability/immutability/provenance to the images, yet produces challenges such as large-image handling, high viewing latency while viewing images, and software inconsistency while storing/loading images. This study aims to store chest x-ray images using a blockchain-based framework to handle large images, improve viewing latency, and enhance software consistency. We developed a splitting and merging function to handle large images, a feature that allows previewing an image earlier to improve viewing latency, and a smart contract to enhance software consistency. We used 920 publicly available images to evaluate the storing and loading methods through time measurements. The blockchain network successfully shares large images up to 18 MB and supports smart contracts to provide code immutability, availability, and provenance. Applying the preview feature successfully shared images 93% faster than sharing images without the preview feature. The findings of this study can guide future studies to generalize our framework to other forms of data to improve sharing and interoperability.",Blockchain|Clinical Research|Diagnostic Imaging|Humans|Image Sharing Interoperability|Software|X-Rays,"Li, Megan Mun|Kuo, Tsung-Ting",International journal of medical informatics,2021,2021-12-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",LM013755,,,,,,U24,False,RADx-rad,Data Coordinating Center

Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained <i>n</i> dyes (<i>n</i> = 2, 3, or 4) with <i>n</i> - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.",Animals|COVID-19|Carbocyanines|Fluorescent Dyes|H-aggregate|Humans|Mice|Mpro.|Peptide Hydrolases|Photoacoustic Techniques|Proteolysis|SARS-CoV-2|activity|cyanine|dimer|photoacoustic|protease|trypsin,"Moore, Colman|Borum, Raina M|Mantri, Yash|Xu, Ming|Fajtová, Pavla|O'Donoghue, Anthony J|Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS sensors,2021,2021-06-25,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DE031114,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

The long-read instrument PacBio CCS had the highest reference-based mapping rate and lowest non-mapping rate. The two long-read platforms PacBio CCS and PromethION/MinION showed the best sequence mapping in repeat-rich areas and across homopolymers. NovaSeq 6000 using 2 × 250-bp read chemistry was the most robust instrument for capturing known insertion/deletion events.

Cross-sectional observational study including coronavirus disease 2019 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection between February 15, 2020, and November 30, 2020, according to age and type of organ support therapies. About 168 hospitals in 16 countries within the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry. Adult hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who did and did not require various types and combinations of organ support (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). None. Primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home with or without assistance and hospital length of stay. Risk-adjusted variation in hospital mortality for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was assessed by using multilevel models with hospitals as a random effect, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities. Among 20,608 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, the mean (± sd) age was 60.5 (±17), 11,1887 (54.3%) were men, 8,745 (42.4%) were admitted to the ICU, and 3,906 (19%) died in the hospital. Hospital mortality was 8.2% for patients receiving no organ support (n = 15,001). The most common organ support therapy was invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5,005; 24.3%), with a hospital mortality of 49.8%. Mortality ranged from 40.8% among patients receiving only invasive mechanical ventilation (n =1,749) to 71.6% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and new renal replacement therapy (n = 655). Mortality was 39% for patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 389). Rates of discharge home ranged from 73.5% for patients who did not require organ support therapies to 29.8% for patients who only received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8.8% for invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement; 10.8% of patients older than 74 years who received invasive mechanical ventilation were discharged home. Median hospital length of stay for patients on mechanical ventilation was 17.1 days (9.7-28 d). Adjusted interhospital variation in mortality among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was large (median odds ratio 1.69).

Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19. We also found that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these network drugs rely on network-based mechanisms that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies.

Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule's known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and α-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism.

There remains an important disconnection between the magnitude and granularity of these data and our ability to improve phenotype-genotype correlations for complex cardiovascular diseases. This shortcoming may be due to limitations associated with traditional reductionist analytical methods, which tend to emphasize a single molecular event in the pathogenesis of diseases more aptly characterized by crosstalk between overlapping molecular pathways. Network medicine is a rapidly growing discipline that considers diseases as the consequences of perturbed interactions between multiple interconnected biological components. This powerful integrative approach has enabled a number of important discoveries in complex disease mechanisms.

The functional genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not obvious due to linkage disequilibrium. We sought to comprehensively investigate whole-genome sequence and RNA sequence from human bronchial epithelial cells to dissect functional genes/SNPs for asthma severity in the Severe Asthma Research Program. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis (n = 114), correlation analysis (n = 156) of gene expression and asthma phenotypes, and pathway analysis were performed in bronchial epithelial cells and replicated. Genetic association for asthma severity (426 severe vs 531 nonsevere asthma) and longitudinal asthma exacerbations (n = 273) was performed. Multiple SNPs in gasdermin B (GSDMB) associated with asthma severity (odds ratio, >1.25) and longitudinal asthma exacerbations (P < .05).

Higher expression levels of GSDMB correlated with asthma and greater number of exacerbations (P < .05). Expression levels of GSDMB correlated with genes involved in IFN signaling, MHC class I antigen presentation, and immune system pathways (false-discovery rate-adjusted P < .05). rs1031458 and rs3902920 in GSDMB colocalized with IFN regulatory factor binding sites and associated with GSDMB expression, asthma severity, and asthma exacerbations (P < .05). By using a unique set of gene expression data from lung cells obtained using bronchoscopy from comprehensively characterized subjects with asthma, we show that SNPs in GSDMB associated with asthma severity, exacerbations, and GSDMB expression levels.

Thus, GSDMB is a functional gene for both asthma susceptibility and severity.","Adult|Antiviral pathways|Asthma|Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17|Disease Progression|GSDMA|GSDMB|Genetic Association Studies|Genotype|Humans|Middle Aged|Neoplasm Proteins|PGAP3|Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide|Quantitative Trait Loci|RNAseq|Respiratory Mucosa|Sequence Analysis, RNA|Severity of Illness Index|Whole Genome Sequencing|asthma exacerbations|asthma severity|eQTL|genetics|whole-genome sequence","Li, Xingnan|Christenson, Stephanie A|Modena, Brian|Li, Huashi|Busse, William W|Castro, Mario|Denlinger, Loren C|Erzurum, Serpil C|Fahy, John V|Gaston, Benjamin|Hastie, Annette T|Israel, Elliot|Jarjour, Nizar N|Levy, Bruce D|Moore, Wendy C|Woodruff, Prescott G|Kaminski, Naftali|Wenzel, Sally E|Bleecker, Eugene R|Meyers, Deborah A|",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2021,2021-03-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL146002,,,,,,U01,True,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Retrospective cohort analysis from March 9, 2020 to June 20, 2020. Population-based study in Louisville, KY, USA. Seven hundred adult inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19. N/A. This cohort consisted of 126 patients (18%) with cardiovascular events and 574 patients without cardiovascular events. Patients with cardiovascular events had a much higher mortality rate than those without cardiovascular events (45.2% v 8.7%, p < 0.001). There was no difference between African American and white patients regarding mortality (43.9% v 46.3%, p = 1) and length of stay for survivors (11 days v 9.5 days, p = 0.301). Multiple logistics regression analysis suggested that male, race, lower SaO2/F<sub>I</sub>O2, higher serum potassium, lower serum albumin, and number of cardiovascular comorbidities were highly associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients. Lower serum albumin and neoplastic and/or immune-compromised diseases were highly associated with cardiovascular events for African American COVID-19 patients. SaO2/F<sub>I</sub>O2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidity count were significantly associated with cardiovascular events in white patients. Cardiovascular events were prevalent and associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

We first apply the SWItch Miner (SWIM) methodology, which predicts important (switch) genes within the co-expression network that regulate disease state transitions, then map them to the human protein-protein interaction network (PPI, or interactome) to predict novel disease-disease relationships (i.e., a SWIM-informed diseasome). Although the relevance of switch genes to an observed phenotype has been recently assessed, their performance at the system or network level constitutes a new, potentially fascinating territory yet to be explored. Quantifying the interplay between switch genes and human diseases in the interactome network, we found that switch genes associated with specific disorders are closer to each other than to other nodes in the network, and tend to form localized connected subnetworks. These subnetworks overlap between similar diseases and are situated in different neighborhoods for pathologically distinct phenotypes, consistent with the well-known topological proximity property of disease genes. These findings allow us to demonstrate how SWIM-based correlation network analysis can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new disease gene associations. When integrated with an interactome-based network analysis, it not only identifies novel candidate disease genes, but also may offer testable hypotheses by which to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of human disease and reveal commonalities between seemingly unrelated diseases.",Causality|Computational Biology|Disease|Gene Expression|Gene Expression Regulation|Humans|Phenotype|Protein Interaction Mapping|Protein Interaction Maps|Systems Biology,"Paci, Paola|Fiscon, Giulia|Conte, Federica|Wang, Rui-Sheng|Farina, Lorenzo|Loscalzo, Joseph",NPJ systems biology and applications,2021,2021-01-21,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In microfluidics, acoustic tweezers typically use an array of sources to create standing wave patterns that can trap and move objects in ways constrained by the limited complexity of the acoustic wave field. Here, we demonstrate spatially complex particle trapping and manipulation inside a boundary-free chamber using a single pair of sources and an engineered structure outside the chamber that we call a shadow waveguide. The shadow waveguide creates a tightly confined, spatially complex acoustic field inside the chamber without requiring any interior structure that would interfere with net flow or transport. Altering the input signals to the two sources creates trapped particle motion along an arbitrary path defined by the shadow waveguide.

Various nanomanipulation functions, including transportation, concentration, orientation, pattern-overlaying, and sorting, have also been achieved using a simple device configuration.

The SPFT-based sorter can be driven with an input power lower than 20 Vpp and maintain a postsorting cell viability of 93.5%. The SPFT sorter can achieve a throughput over 1000 events per second and a sorting purity up to 99.2%.

We examined if use of shared chairs in outpatient hemodialysis associates with a risk for indirect patient-to-patient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We used data from adults treated at 2,600 hemodialysis facilities in United States between February 1st and June 8th, 2020. We performed a retrospective case-control study matching each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient (case) to a non-SARS-CoV-2 patient (control) treated in the same dialysis shift. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, race, facility, shift date, and treatment count. For each case-control pair, we traced backward 14 days to assess possible prior exposure from a 'shedding' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient who sat in the same chair immediately before the case or control. Conditional logistic regression models tested whether chair exposure after a shedding SARS-CoV-2 positive patient conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the immediate subsequent patient. Among 170,234 hemodialysis patients, 4,782 (2.8 %) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean age 64 years, 44 % female). Most facilities (68.5 %) had 0 to 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient. We matched 2,379 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases to 2,379 non-SARS-CoV-2 controls; 1.30 % (95 %CI 0.90 %, 1.87 %) of cases and 1.39 % (95 %CI 0.97 %, 1.97 %) of controls were exposed to a chair previously sat in by a shedding SARS-CoV-2 patient. Transmission risk among cases was not significantly different from controls (OR = 0.94; 95 %CI 0.57 to 1.54; p = 0.80). Results remained consistent in adjusted and sensitivity analyses. The risk of indirect patient-to-patient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from dialysis chairs appears to be low.","Aged|Ambulatory Care Facilities|COVID-19|Case-Control Studies|End Stage Renal Disease|Environmental Exposure|Female|Fomites|Hemodialysis|Humans|Infection Control|Interior Design and Furnishings|Kidney Failure|Logistic Models|Male|Middle Aged|Models, Theoretical|Outpatients|Renal Dialysis|Retrospective Studies|Risk|SARS-CoV-2|United States|Virus Shedding","Thadhani, Ravi|Willetts, Joanna|Wang, Catherine|Larkin, John|Zhang, Hanjie|Fuentes, Lemuel Rivera|Usvyat, Len|Belmonte, Kathleen|Wang, Yuedong|Kossmann, Robert|Hymes, Jeffrey|Kotanko, Peter|Maddux, Franklin",BMC nephrology,2021,2021-09-16,"Comparative Study|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DK130067,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

Traditional disease diagnostic methods such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) require multiple steps, trained technicians, and long turnaround time that may worsen the disease surveillance and pandemic control. In sight of this situation, a rapid, one-step, easy-to-use, and high-accuracy diagnostic platform will be valuable for future epidemic control, especially for regions with scarce medical resources. Herein, we report a magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) platform for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biomarkers: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This technique monitors the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses their higher harmonics as a measure of the nanoparticles' binding states. By anchoring polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) onto MNP surfaces, these nanoparticles function as nanoprobes to specifically bind to target analytes (SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in this work) and form nanoparticle clusters. This binding event causes detectable changes in higher harmonics and allows for quantitative and qualitative detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. We have achieved detection limits of 1.56 nM (equivalent to 125 fmole) and 12.5 nM (equivalent to 1 pmole) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. This MPS platform combined with the one-step, wash-free, nanoparticle clustering-based assay method is intrinsically versatile and allows for the detection of a variety of other disease biomarkers by simply changing the surface functional groups on MNPs.","COVID-19|Cluster Analysis|Humans|Nanoparticles|Nucleocapsid Proteins|SARS-CoV-2|Spectrum Analysis|Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus|disease diagnostics|magnetic nanoparticle|magnetic particle spectroscopy|nucleocapsid protein|spike protein","Wu, Kai|Chugh, Vinit Kumar|D Krishna, Venkatramana|di Girolamo, Arturo|Wang, Yongqiang Andrew|Saha, Renata|Liang, Shuang|Cheeran, Maxim C-J|Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,2021-09-22,Journal Article,DE030832,,,,,,R42,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19. This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean±SD, C19+: -82.5±27.2 points; C19-: -59.8±37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing no significant model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset. As smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss.

We studied healthy 3- to 4-month-old lambs weighing 34 ± 4 kg (mean ± SD, n = 6). A transtracheal Scoop catheter was inserted through a cuffed tracheostomy tube. U46619 was infused to increase mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) from 16 ± 1 to 32 ± 3 mmHg (mean ± SD). Electrically generated NO was delivered via the Scoop catheter to awake lambs. A sampling line, to monitor NO and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels, was placed in the distal trachea of the lambs. The effect of varying doses of electrically generated NO, produced continuously, on pulmonary hypertension was assessed. In awake lambs with acute pulmonary hypertension, NO was continuously delivered via the Scoop catheter at 400 ml/min. NO induced pulmonary vasodilation. NO<sub>2</sub> levels, measured in the trachea, were below 0.5 ppm at intratracheal NO doses of 10-80 ppm. No changes were detected in the levels of methemoglobin in blood samples before and after 5 min of NO breathing. Continuously delivering electrically generated NO through a Scoop catheter produces vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature of awake lambs with pulmonary hypertension.

Recent advances have clarified the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) range that is above normal and is associated with clinical events, including mortality. This progress has for the first time resulted in a new clinical definition of PH that is evidenced-based, is inclusive of mPAP >20 mm Hg, and emphasizes early diagnosis. Additionally, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 2.2 to 3.0 WU, considered previously to be normal, appears to associate with elevated clinical risk. A revised approach to classifying PH patients as pre-capillary, isolated post-capillary, or combined pre-/post-capillary PH now guides point-of-care diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. Exercise hemodynamic or confrontational fluid challenge studies may also aid decision-making for patients with PH-LHD or otherwise unexplained dyspnea. This collective progress in pulmonary vascular and heart failure medicine reinforces the critical importance of accurate hemodynamic assessment.","Heart Failure|Hemodynamics|Humans|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Risk Assessment|heart failure|hemodynamics|pulmonary hypertension","Maron, Bradley A|Kovacs, Gabor|Vaidya, Anjali|Bhatt, Deepak L|Nishimura, Rick A|Mak, Susanna|Guazzi, Marco|Tedford, Ryan J",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2020,2020-12-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We sought to develop a continuous measure of asthma severity, the Asthma Severity Scoring System (ASSESS), for adolescents and adults, incorporating domains of asthma control, lung function, medications, and exacerbations. Baseline and 36-month longitudinal data from participants in phase 3 of the Severe Asthma Research Program (NCT01606826) were used. Scale properties, responsiveness, and a minimally important difference were determined. External replication was performed in participants enrolled in the Severe Asthma Research Program phase 1/2. The utility of ASSESS for detecting treatment response was explored in participants undergoing corticosteroid responsiveness testing with intramuscular triamcinolone and participants receiving biologics. ASSESS scores ranged from 0 to 20 (8.78 ± 3.9; greater scores reflect worse severity) and differed among 5 phenotypic groups. Measurement properties were acceptable. ASSESS was responsive to changes in quality of life with a minimally important difference of 2, with good specificity for outcomes of asthma improvement and worsening but poor sensitivity. Replication analyses yielded similar results, with a 2-point decrease (improvement) associated with improvements in quality of life. Participants with a 2-point or greater decrease (improvement) in ASSESS scores also had greater improvement in lung function and asthma control after triamcinolone, but these differences were limited to phenotypic clusters 3, 4, and 5. Participants treated with biologics also had a 2-point or greater decrease (improvement) in ASSESS scores overall. The ASSESS tool is an objective measure that might be useful in epidemiologic and clinical research studies for quantification of treatment response in individual patients and phenotypic groups.

Here, we show that data from consumer smartwatches can be used for the pre-symptomatic detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analysed physiological and activity data from 32 individuals infected with COVID-19, identified from a cohort of nearly 5,300 participants, and found that 26 of them (81%) had alterations in their heart rate, number of daily steps or time asleep. Of the 25 cases of COVID-19 with detected physiological alterations for which we had symptom information, 22 were detected before (or at) symptom onset, with four cases detected at least nine days earlier. Using retrospective smartwatch data, we show that 63% of the COVID-19 cases could have been detected before symptom onset in real time via a two-tiered warning system based on the occurrence of extreme elevations in resting heart rate relative to the individual baseline. Our findings suggest that activity tracking and health monitoring via consumer wearable devices may be used for the large-scale, real-time detection of respiratory infections, often pre-symptomatically.","Adult|Asymptomatic Diseases|COVID-19|Female|Humans|Male|Monitoring, Physiologic|Pandemics|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2|Wearable Electronic Devices","Mishra, Tejaswini|Wang, Meng|Metwally, Ahmed A|Bogu, Gireesh K|Brooks, Andrew W|Bahmani, Amir|Alavi, Arash|Celli, Alessandra|Higgs, Emily|Dagan-Rosenfeld, Orit|Fay, Bethany|Kirkpatrick, Susan|Kellogg, Ryan|Gibson, Michelle|Wang, Tao|Hunting, Erika M|Mamic, Petra|Ganz, Ariel B|Rolnik, Benjamin|Li, Xiao|Snyder, Michael P",Nature biomedical engineering,2020,2020-12-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NR020105,,,,,,R01,False,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance

This is a retrospective single-center study of patients younger than 21 years presenting between March 1 and May 15, 2020. Included patients met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C (inflammation, fever, involvement of 2 organ systems, lack of alternative diagnoses). We defined 3 subgroups by clinical outcomes: (1) critical illness requiring intensive care interventions; (2) patients meeting Kawasaki disease (KD) criteria but not requiring critical care; and (3) mild illness not meeting either criteria. A comparator cohort included patients with KD at our institution during the same time frame in 2019. Thirty-three patients were included (5, critical; 8, 2020 KD; 20, mild). The median age for the critical group was 10.9 years (2.7 for 2020 KD; 6.0 for mild, P = 0.033). The critical group had lower median absolute lymphocyte count (850 vs 3005 vs 2940/uL, P = 0.005), platelets (150 vs 361 vs 252 k/uL, P = 0.005), and sodium (129 vs 136 vs 136 mmol/L, P = 0.002), and higher creatinine (0.7 vs 0.2 vs 0.3 mg/dL, P = 0.002). In the critical group, 60% required vasoactive medications, and 40% required mechanical ventilation. Clinical and laboratories features were similar between the 2020 and 2019 KD groups. We describe 3 groups with inflammatory syndromes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The initial profile of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and abnormal creatinine may help distinguish critically ill MIS-C patients from classic/atypical KD or more benign acute inflammation.","Adolescent|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Child|Coronavirus Infections|Critical Care|Diagnosis, Differential|Disease Management|Female|Humans|Male|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|Retrospective Studies|SARS-CoV-2","Corwin, Daniel J|Sartori, Laura F|Chiotos, Kathleen|Odom John, Audrey R|Cohn, Keri|Bassiri, Hamid|Behrens, Edward M|Teachey, David T|Henrickson, Sarah E|Diorio, Caroline J|Zorc, Joseph J|Balamuth, Fran",Pediatric emergency care,2020,2020-11-01,Journal Article,HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

Given prior evidence in the literature and our observations from the subjects in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), we hypothesized that PE, maternal asthma, vitamin D insufficiency, and excess body mass index (BMI) might share both peripheral blood and placental gene signatures that link these conditions together. We used samples collected in the VDAART to investigate relationships between these four conditions and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood obtained at early pregnancy. We identified a core set of differentially expressed genes in all comparisons between women with and without these four conditions and confirmed them in two separate sets of samples. We confirmed the differential expression of the shared gene signatures in the placenta from an independent study of preeclampsia cases and controls and constructed the preeclampsia module using protein-protein interaction networks. CXC chemokine genes showed the highest degrees of connectivity and betweenness centrality in the peripheral blood and placental modules. The shared gene signatures demonstrate the biological pathways involved in preeclampsia at the pre-clinical stage and may be used for the prediction of preeclampsia.","Adult|Asthma|Body Mass Index|Chemokines|Female|Humans|Placenta|Pre-Eclampsia|Pregnancy|Pregnancy Trimester, First|Pregnancy Trimester, Second|Transcriptome|Vitamin D|Vitamin D Deficiency|Young Adult","Yadama, Aishwarya P|Maiorino, Enrico|Carey, Vincent J|McElrath, Thomas F|Litonjua, Augusto A|Loscalzo, Joseph|Weiss, Scott T|Mirzakhani, Hooman",Scientific reports,2020,2020-10-12,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Tastes and smells can warn against danger and also contribute to the daily enjoyment of food, friends and family, and our surroundings. Over 12% of the US population is estimated to experience taste and smell (chemosensory) dysfunction. Yet, despite this high prevalence, long-term, effective treatments for these disorders have been largely elusive. Clinical successes in other sensory systems, including hearing and vision, have led to new hope for developments in the treatment of chemosensory disorders. To accelerate cures, we convened the ""Identifying Treatments for Taste and Smell Disorders"" conference, bringing together basic and translational sensory scientists, health care professionals, and patients to identify gaps in our current understanding of chemosensory dysfunction and next steps in a broad-based research strategy. Their suggestions for high-yield next steps were focused in 3 areas: increasing awareness and research capacity (e.g., patient advocacy), developing and enhancing clinical measures of taste and smell, and supporting new avenues of research into cellular and therapeutic approaches (e.g., developing human chemosensory cell lines, stem cells, and gene therapy approaches). These long-term strategies led to specific suggestions for immediate research priorities that focus on expanding our understanding of specific responses of chemosensory cells and developing valuable assays to identify and document cell development, regeneration, and function. Addressing these high-priority areas should accelerate the development of novel and effective treatments for taste and smell disorders.",Congresses as Topic|Genetic Therapy|Humans|Olfaction Disorders|Regenerative Medicine|Small Molecule Libraries|Stem Cell Transplantation|Stem Cells|Taste Disorders|cell culture|olfaction|sniff,"Mainland, Joel D|Barlow, Linda A|Munger, Steven D|Millar, Sarah E|Vergara, M Natalia|Jiang, Peihua|Schwob, James E|Goldstein, Bradley J|Boye, Shannon E|Martens, Jeffrey R|Leopold, Donald A|Bartoshuk, Linda M|Doty, Richard L|Hummel, Thomas|Pinto, Jayant M|Trimmer, Casey|Kelly, Christine|Pribitkin, Edmund A|Reed, Danielle R",Chemical senses,2020,2020-10-09,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

We sought to determine whether similar findings were present in patients with asthma and whether these findings were explained by differences in ventricular size. We measured the PA and aorta diameters in 233 individuals from the Severe Asthma Research Program III cohort. We also estimated right, left, and total epicardial cardiac ventricular volume indices (eERVVI, eELVVI, and eETVVI, respectively). Associations between the cardiac and PA measures (PA-to-aorta [PA/A] ratio, eERVVI-to-eELVVI [eRV/eLV] ratio, eERVVI, eELVVI, eETVVI) and clinical measures of asthma severity were assessed by Pearson correlation, and associations with asthma severity and exacerbation rate were evaluated by multivariable linear and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Asthma severity was associated with smaller ventricular volumes. For example, those with severe asthma had 36.1 mL/m<sup>2</sup> smaller eETVVI than healthy control subjects (P = .003) and 14.1 mL/m<sup>2</sup> smaller eETVVI than those with mild/moderate disease (P = .011). Smaller ventricular volumes were also associated with a higher rate of asthma exacerbations, both retrospectively and prospectively. For example, those with an eETVVI less than the median had a 57% higher rate of exacerbations during follow-up than those with eETVVI greater than the median (P = .020). Neither PA/A nor eRV/eLV was associated with asthma severity or exacerbations. In patients with asthma, smaller cardiac ventricular size may be associated with more severe disease and a higher rate of asthma exacerbations.

Disease progression is due in part to dysregulation of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling in the lungs and increased lung-cell apoptosis. Here we asked whether PR1P (Prominin-1-derived peptide), a novel short peptide we designed that increases VEGF binding to endothelial cells, could be used to improve outcome in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of emphysema. We used computer simulation and <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies to show that PR1P upregulated endogenous VEGF receptor-2 signaling by binding VEGF and preventing its proteolytic degradation. In so doing, PR1P mitigated toxin-induced lung-cell apoptosis, including from cigarette-smoke extract <i>in vitro</i> and from LPS <i>in vivo</i> in mice. Remarkably, inhaled PR1P led to significantly increased VEGF concentrations in murine lungs within 30 minutes that remained greater than twofold above that of control animals 24 hours later. Finally, inhaled PR1P reduced acute lung injury in 4- and 21-day elastase-induced murine emphysema models. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of PR1P as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of emphysema or other lung diseases characterized by VEGF signaling dysregulation.","Animals|Apoptosis|Computer Simulation|Disease Models, Animal|Endothelial Cells|Female|LPS|Lung|Mice|Mice, Inbred C3H|Pancreatic Elastase|Peptides|Prominin-1–derived peptide|Pulmonary Alveoli|Pulmonary Emphysema|Signal Transduction|Smoke|Up-Regulation|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2|apoptosis|emphysema|vascular endothelial growth factor","Adini, Avner|Wu, Hao|Dao, Duy T|Ko, Victoria H|Yu, Lumeng J|Pan, Amy|Puder, Mark|Mitiku, Selome Z|Potla, Ratnakar|Chen, Hong|Rice, James M|Matthews, Benjamin D",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2020,2020-10-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Transition models were used to assess uninformed and informed probabilities of exacerbation in year 3. Binomial regression models were used to assess eosinophils and IL-6 as predictive biomarkers.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Eighty-three participants (21%) had ≥1 exacerbation in each year (EPA) and 168 participants (41%) had no exacerbation in any year (exacerbation-resistant asthma). The uninformed probability of an exacerbation in Year 3 was 40%, but the informed probability increased to 63% with an exacerbation in Year 2 and 82% with an exacerbation in Years 1 and 2. The probability of a Year 3 exacerbation with no Year 1 or 2 exacerbations was 13%. Compared with exacerbation-resistant asthma, EPA was characterized by lower FEV<sub>1</sub> and a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. High-plasma IL-6 occurred in EPA, and the incident rate ratio for exacerbation increased 10% for each 1-pg/μl increase in baseline IL-6 level. Although high blood eosinophils did not occur in EPA, the incident rate ratio for exacerbations increased 9% for each 100-cell/μl increase in baseline eosinophil number.<b>Conclusions:</b> Longitudinal analysis confirms an EPA phenotype characterized by features of metabolic dysfunction.

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients. We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18). As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001).

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""smell,"" and/or ""olfaction."" We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss-subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli-to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.",COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|anosmia|coronavirus|olfactory dysfunction,"Hannum, Mackenzie E|Ramirez, Vicente A|Lipson, Sarah J|Herriman, Riley D|Toskala, Aurora K|Lin, Cailu|Joseph, Paule V|Reed, Danielle R",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2020,2020-07-06,Journal Article|Preprint,DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

We created a human calcification endophenotype module (ie, the ""calcificasome"") by mapping vascular calcification genes (proteins) to the human vascular smooth muscle-specific protein-protein interactome (218 nodes and 632 edges, P < 10<sup>-5</sup> ). Network proximity analysis was used to demonstrate that the calcificasome overlapped significantly with endophenotype modules governing inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrosis in the human interactome (P < 0.001). A network-based drug repurposing analysis further revealed that everolimus, temsirolimus, and pomalidomide are predicted to target the calcificasome. The efficacy of these agents in limiting calcification was confirmed experimentally by treating human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in an in vitro calcification assay. Each of the drugs affected expression or activity of their predicted target in the network, and decreased calcification significantly (P < 0.009). An integrated network analytical approach identified novel mediators of ectopic cardiovascular calcification and biologically plausible candidate drugs that could be repurposed to target calcification. This methodological framework for drug repurposing has broad applicability to other diseases.","Calcinosis|Cells, Cultured|Coronary Vessels|Fibrosis|Humans|Inflammation|Muscle, Smooth, Vascular|Myocytes, Smooth Muscle|Pharmaceutical Preparations|Thrombosis|Vascular Calcification|blood vessel|calcification|protein interaction|smooth muscle cell|therapeutics","Song, Euijun|Wang, Rui-Sheng|Leopold, Jane A|Loscalzo, Joseph",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2020,2020-08-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Although the majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multiorgan involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.",Acute Disease|COVID-19|COVID-19 Drug Treatment|Child|Humans|IL-1|IL-6|Immunomodulation|Risk Assessment|SARS-CoV-2|Severity of Illness Index|immunomodulatory therapy,"Dulek, Daniel E|Fuhlbrigge, Robert C|Tribble, Alison C|Connelly, James A|Loi, Michele M|El Chebib, Hassan|Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan|Otto, William R|Diorio, Caroline|Keim, Garrett|Walkovich, Kelly|Jaggi, Preeti|Girotto, Jennifer E|Yarbrough, April|Behrens, Edward M|Cron, Randy Q|Bassiri, Hamid",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2020,2020-12-31,Journal Article,HD105594,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds
32798637,,doi:10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.08.003,Hyperbaric polymer microcapsules for tunable oxygen delivery.,"Over the past decade, there have been many attempts to engineer systems capable of delivering oxygen to overcome the effects of both systemic and local hypoxia that occurs as a result of traumatic injury, cell transplantation, or tumor growth, among many others. Despite progress in this field, which has led to a new class of oxygen-generating biomaterials, most reported techniques lack the tunability necessary for independent control over the oxygen flux (volume per unit time) and the duration of delivery, both of which are key parameters for overcoming tissue hypoxia of varying etiologies. Here, we show that these critical parameters can be effectively manipulated using hyperbarically-loaded polymeric microcapsules (PMC). PMCs are micron-sized particles with hollow cores and polymeric shells. We show that oxygen delivery through PMCs is dependent on its permeability through the polymeric shell, the shell thickness, and the pressure gradient across the shell. We also demonstrate that incorporating an intermediate oil layer between the polymeric shell and the gas core prevents rapid outgassing by effectively lowering the resultant pressure gradient across the polymeric membrane following depressurization.",Biocompatible Materials|Capsules|Delivery|Hyperbaric|Hypoxia|Microcapsule|Oxygen|Polymers|Pressurization,"Nguyen, Tien|Peng, Yifeng|Seekell, Raymond P|Kheir, John N|Polizzotti, Brian D",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2020,2020-11-10,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation, and initial results of a multilingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in 3 distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste, and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± standard deviation), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and the lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Adult|Aged|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Female|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Olfaction Disorders|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS-CoV-2|Self Report|Smell|Somatosensory Disorders|Surveys and Questionnaires|Taste|Taste Disorders|Young Adult|head and neck surgery|olfaction|somatosensation","Parma, Valentina|Ohla, Kathrin|Veldhuizen, Maria G|Niv, Masha Y|Kelly, Christine E|Bakke, Alyssa J|Cooper, Keiland W|Bouysset, Cédric|Pirastu, Nicola|Dibattista, Michele|Kaur, Rishemjit|Liuzza, Marco Tullio|Pepino, Marta Y|Schöpf, Veronika|Pereda-Loth, Veronica|Olsson, Shannon B|Gerkin, Richard C|Rohlfs Domínguez, Paloma|Albayay, Javier|Farruggia, Michael C|Bhutani, Surabhi|Fjaeldstad, Alexander W|Kumar, Ritesh|Menini, Anna|Bensafi, Moustafa|Sandell, Mari|Konstantinidis, Iordanis|Di Pizio, Antonella|Genovese, Federica|Öztürk, Lina|Thomas-Danguin, Thierry|Frasnelli, Johannes|Boesveldt, Sanne|Saatci, Özlem|Saraiva, Luis R|Lin, Cailu|Golebiowski, Jérôme|Hwang, Liang-Dar|Ozdener, Mehmet Hakan|Guàrdia, Maria Dolors|Laudamiel, Christophe|Ritchie, Marina|Havlícek, Jan|Pierron, Denis|Roura, Eugeni|Navarro, Marta|Nolden, Alissa A|Lim, Juyun|Whitcroft, Katherine L|Colquitt, Lauren R|Ferdenzi, Camille|Brindha, Evelyn V|Altundag, Aytug|Macchi, Alberto|Nunez-Parra, Alexia|Patel, Zara M|Fiorucci, Sébastien|Philpott, Carl M|Smith, Barry C|Lundström, Johan N|Mucignat, Carla|Parker, Jane K|van den Brink, Mirjam|Schmuker, Michael|Fischmeister, Florian Ph S|Heinbockel, Thomas|Shields, Vonnie D C|Faraji, Farhoud|Santamaría, Enrique|Fredborg, William E A|Morini, Gabriella|Olofsson, Jonas K|Jalessi, Maryam|Karni, Noam|D'Errico, Anna|Alizadeh, Rafieh|Pellegrino, Robert|Meyer, Pablo|Huart, Caroline|Chen, Ben|Soler, Graciela M|Alwashahi, Mohammed K|Welge-Lüssen, Antje|Freiherr, Jessica|de Groot, Jasper H B|Klein, Hadar|Okamoto, Masako|Singh, Preet Bano|Hsieh, Julien W||Reed, Danielle R|Hummel, Thomas|Munger, Steven D|Hayes, John E",Chemical senses,2020,2020-10-09,"Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DC019578,,,,,,U01,False,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Many different analytical methods have been used to infer relevant molecular networks, including protein-protein interaction networks, correlation-based networks, gene regulatory networks, and Bayesian networks. Network Medicine applies these integrated approaches to Omics Big Data (including genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) using computational biology tools and, thereby, has the potential to provide improvements in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of complex diseases. We discuss briefly the types of molecular data that are used in molecular network analyses, survey the analytical methods for inferring molecular networks, and review efforts to validate and visualize molecular networks. Successful applications of molecular network analysis have been reported in pulmonary arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, and drug development. Important knowledge gaps in Network Medicine include incompleteness of the molecular interactome, challenges in identifying key genes within genetic association regions, and limited applications to human diseases.

A novel NO delivery system is described. We developed a gas delivery system that utilizes standard respiratory circuit connectors, a reservoir bag, and a scavenging chamber containing calcium hydroxide. The performance of the system was tested using a mechanical lung, assessing the NO concentration delivered at varying inspiratory flows. Safety was assessed in vitro and in vivo by measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the delivered NO gas. Lastly, we measured the inspired and expired NO and NO<sub>2</sub> of this system in 5 healthy subjects during a 15-min administration of high dose NO (160 parts-per-million, ppm) using our delivery system. The system demonstrated stable delivery of prescribed NO levels at various inspiratory flow rates (0-50 L/min). The reservoir bag and a high flow of entering air minimized the oscillation of NO concentrations during inspiration on average 4.6 ppm for each 10 L/min increment in lung inspiratory flow. The calcium hydroxide scavenger reduced the inhaled NO<sub>2</sub> concentration on average 0.9 ppm (95% CI -1.58, -0.22; p = .01). We performed 49 NO administrations of 160 ppm in 5 subjects. The average concentration of inspired NO was 164.8±10.74 ppm, with inspired NO<sub>2</sub> levels of 0.7±0.13 ppm. The subjects did not experience any adverse events; transcutaneous methemoglobin concentrations increased from 1.05±0.58 to 2.26±0.47%.

Here, using a murine renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) model, we show that intercalated cells (ICs) rapidly adopted a proinflammatory phenotype after IRI. Wwe demonstrate that during the early phase of AKI either blockade of the proinflammatory P2Y14 receptor located on the apical membrane of ICs or ablation of the gene encoding the P2Y14 receptor in ICs (a) inhibited IRI-induced increase of chemokine expression in ICs, (b) reduced neutrophil and monocyte renal infiltration, (c) reduced the extent of kidney dysfunction, and (d) attenuated proximal tubule damage. These observations indicate that the P2Y14 receptor participates in the very first inflammatory steps associated with ischemic AKI. In addition, we show that the concentration of the P2Y14 receptor ligand UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) was higher in urine samples from intensive care unit patients who developed AKI compared with patients without AKI. In particular, we observed a strong correlation between UDP-Glc concentration and the development of AKI in cardiac surgery patients. Our study identifies the UDP-Glc/P2Y14 receptor axis as a potential target for the prevention and/or attenuation of ischemic AKI.","Acute Kidney Injury|Animals|Cellular immune response|Chemokines|Inflammation|Ischemia|Kidney|Mice|Mice, Knockout|Monocytes|Nephrology|Neutrophil Infiltration|Neutrophils|Receptors, Purinergic P2Y","Battistone, Maria Agustina|Mendelsohn, Alexandra C|Spallanzani, Raul German|Allegretti, Andrew S|Liberman, Rachel N|Sesma, Juliana|Kalim, Sahir|Wall, Susan M|Bonventre, Joseph V|Lazarowski, Eduardo R|Brown, Dennis|Breton, Sylvie",The Journal of clinical investigation,2020,2020-07-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In addition to synaptic interactions, central processing is also influenced by the ion channel composition of individual neurons. For example, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels such as outward K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>A</sub>) can modify the integrative properties of neurons. <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> currents are prevalent in rNST projection cells but are also found to a lesser extent in GABAergic interneurons. However, characterization of the kinetic properties of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub>, the molecular basis of these currents, as well as the consequences of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> on spiking properties of identified rNST cells is lacking. Here, we show that <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in rNST GABAergic (G+) and non-GABAergic (G-) neurons share a common molecular basis. In both cell types, there was a reduction in <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> following treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTx3. However, the kinetics of activation and inactivation of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in the two cell types were different with G- neurons having significantly more negative half-maximal activation and inactivation values. Likewise, under current clamp, G- cells had significantly longer delays to spike initiation in response to a depolarizing stimulus preceded by a hyperpolarizing prepulse. Computational modeling and dynamic clamp suggest that differences in the activation half-maximum may account for the differences in delay. We further observed evidence for a window current under both voltage clamp and current clamp protocols. We speculate that the location of Kv4.3 channels on dendrites, together with a window current for <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> at rest, serves to regulate excitatory afferent inputs.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Here, we demonstrate that the transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> occurs in both GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons via Kv4.3 channels in the rostral (gustatory) solitary nucleus. Although found in both cell types, <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> is more prevalent in non-GABAergic cells; a larger conductance at more negative potentials leads to a greater impact on spike initiation compared with GABAergic neurons. An <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> window current further suggests that <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> can regulate excitatory afferent input to the nucleus.","Animals|Electrophysiological Phenomena|Female|GABAergic Neurons|Interneurons|Male|Mice|Mice, Transgenic|Shal Potassium Channels|Solitary Nucleus|Taste Perception|brain stem|computational model|dynamic clamp|mouse|taste","Chen, Z|Boxwell, A|Conte, C|Haas, T|Harley, A|Terman, D H|Travers, S P|Travers, J B",Journal of neurophysiology,2020,2020-12-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Sensitive and specific immunoassays provide the ability to identify exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to determine seroconversion, to confirm eligibility for donation of convalescent plasma as well as play an essential part in epidemiological studies. We report on the validation of the Ansh Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgM ELISA immunoassays. These assays were evaluated for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies for clinical use in our hospital as part of an orthogonal testing algorithm recommended by the CDC. Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the IgG and IgM ELISA assays were tested using samples confirmed to be negative or positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. We also evaluated precision, analytical interference, and cross-reactivity with known cases of infection with other viruses. Additionally, we validated concordance with molecular and other serological testing and evaluated seroconversion in our patient population. The IgG and IgM ELISA assays showed acceptable precision, were robust to analytical interference and did not exhibit cross reactivity with specimens positive for common respiratory viruses. Both assays exhibited 95% agreement with a primary screening serological assay utilized at our institution as well as with a reference laboratory semi-quantitative method. Concordance with RT-PCR was excellent > 6 days after symptom onset (100%). The Ansh SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assays have good analytical performance suitable for clinical use.","Betacoronavirus|Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay|Epitopes|Humans|IgG, IgM|Immunoglobulin G|Immunoglobulin M|SARS CoV-2 antibody|SARS-CoV-2|Serology|Validation","Jung, Joanna|Garnett, Emily|Jariwala, Purviben|Pham, Hue|Huang, Rongrong|Benzi, Eduardo|Issaq, Niveen|Matzuk, Martin|Singh, Ila|Devaraj, Sridevi",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2020,2020-11-01,Journal Article,HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

In a bifunctional AND-gate protein, the molecular geometry of the protein domains is crucial. Here we constructed a tissue-targeted erythropoietin (EPO) that stimulates red blood cell (RBC) production without triggering thrombosis. The EPO was directed to RBC precursors and mature RBCs by fusion to an anti-glycophorin A antibody V region. Many such constructs activated EPO receptors <i>in vitro</i> and stimulated RBC and not platelet production in mice but nonetheless enhanced thrombosis in mice and caused adhesion between RBCs and EPO-receptor-bearing cells. On the basis of a protein-structural model of the RBC surface, we rationally designed an anti-glycophorin-EPO fusion that does not induce cell adhesion <i>in vitro</i> or enhance thrombosis <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, mesoscale geometry can inform the design of synthetic-biological systems.","Animals|Cell Communication|Cell Line|Darbepoetin alfa|Epitopes|Erythrocytes|Erythropoietin|Glycophorins|Hemorrhage|Humans|Ligands|Mice|Mice, Transgenic|Mutagenesis, Site-Directed|Protein Engineering|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Single-Chain Antibodies|erythropoietin|fusion protein|glycophorin A|nanobody|peptide linker|thrombosis","Lee, Jungmin|Vernet, Andyna|Redfield, Katherine|Lu, Shulin|Ghiran, Ionita C|Way, Jeffrey C|Silver, Pamela A",ACS synthetic biology,2020,2020-02-21,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples and was concordant with other serologic assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% more than 7 days after symptom onset. The CoV2T assay was robust to icterus and lipemia but had interference from significant hemolysis. The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, the use of the CoV2T and other serologic assays in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 is unknown and must be evaluated in future studies.","Antibodies, Viral|Betacoronavirus|COVID-19|COVID-19 Testing|Clinical Laboratory Techniques|Coronavirus|Coronavirus Infections|Humans|IgG|IgM|Immunoassay|Pandemics|Pneumonia, Viral|SARS CoV-2 antibody|SARS-CoV-2|Sensitivity and Specificity|Serologic Tests|Serology|alidation","Garnett, Emily|Jung, Joanna|Tam, Estella|Rajapakshe, Deepthi|Cheney, Stephen|Brown, Cameron|Cao, Jing|Muldrew, Kenneth|Singh, Ila|Versalovic, James|Devaraj, Sridevi",American journal of clinical pathology,2020,2020-11-04,Journal Article|Validation Study,HD105593,,,,,,R61,False,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds

In this study, we develop a Genome-wide Positioning Systems network (GPSnet) algorithm for drug repurposing by specifically targeting disease modules derived from individual patient's DNA and RNA sequencing profiles mapped to the human protein-protein interactome network. We investigate whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome profiles from ~5,000 patients across 15 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that GPSnet-predicted disease modules can predict drug responses and prioritize new indications for 140 approved drugs. Importantly, we experimentally validate that an approved cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure drug, ouabain, shows potential antitumor activities in lung adenocarcinoma by uniquely targeting a HIF1α/LEO1-mediated cell metabolism pathway. In summary, GPSnet offers a network-based, in silico drug repurposing framework for more efficacious therapeutic selections.","Adenocarcinoma of Lung|Algorithms|Arrhythmias, Cardiac|Computer Simulation|Datasets as Topic|Drug Repositioning|Feasibility Studies|Gene Regulatory Networks|Heart Failure|Holistic Health|Humans|Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit|Lung Neoplasms|Metabolic Networks and Pathways|Molecular Targeted Therapy|Ouabain|Protein Interaction Maps|Systems Biology|Transcription Factors|Transcriptome","Cheng, Feixiong|Lu, Weiqiang|Liu, Chuang|Fang, Jiansong|Hou, Yuan|Handy, Diane E|Wang, Ruisheng|Zhao, Yuzheng|Yang, Yi|Huang, Jin|Hill, David E|Vidal, Marc|Eng, Charis|Loscalzo, Joseph",Nature communications,2019,2019-08-02,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Validation Study",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, limitations of this hypothesis suggest that sarcomere mutations alone do not adequately explain all HCM clinical and pathobiological features. Disease-causing sarcomere mutations are absent in ∼70% of patients with established disease, and sarcomere gene carriers can live to advanced ages without developing HCM. Some features of HCM are also inconsistent with the single sarcomere gene hypothesis, such as regional left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, as well as structurally abnormal elongated mitral valve leaflets and remodeled intramural coronary arterioles, which involve tissue types that do not express cardiomyocyte sarcomere proteins. It is timely to expand the HCM research focus beyond a single molecular event toward more inclusive models to explain this disease in its entirety. The authors chart paths forward addressing this knowledge gap using novel analytical approaches, particularly network medicine, to unravel the pathobiological complexity of HCM.","Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic|Female|Genetic Heterogeneity|Genetic Predisposition to Disease|Humans|Male|Mutation|Prevalence|Prognosis|Risk Assessment|Sarcomeres|Survival Analysis|genetics|hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|network medicine","Maron, Barry J|Maron, Martin S|Maron, Bradley A|Loscalzo, Joseph",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2019,2019-04-23,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

IR binds insulin at the cell surface and transduces rapid signaling via cytoplasmic kinases. However, mechanisms mediating long-term effects of insulin remain unclear. Here, we show that IR associates with RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, with striking enrichment at promoters genome-wide. The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including lipid metabolism and protein synthesis and diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. IR chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by IR was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) and transcription factors, revealing an HCF-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin. These results show that IR interacts with transcriptional machinery at promoters and identify a pathway regulating genes linked to insulin's effects in physiology and disease.","Animals|Cell Line, Tumor|Chromatin|Gene Expression Regulation|Genome-Wide Association Study|HCFC1|Host Cell Factor C1|Humans|INSR|Insulin|Liver|Male|Mice|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Protein Binding|Protein Subunits|RNA Interference|RNA Polymerase II|RNA polymerase II|RNA, Small Interfering|Receptor, Insulin|Signal Transduction|coregulator host cell factor-1|gene promoter|insulin receptor signaling|nuclear receptor tyrosine kinase|transcription factor","Hancock, Melissa L|Meyer, Rebecca C|Mistry, Meeta|Khetani, Radhika S|Wagschal, Alexandre|Shin, Taehwan|Ho Sui, Shannan J|Näär, Anders M|Flanagan, John G",Cell,2019,2019-04-18,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
30288739,PMC6295404,doi:10.1111/bph.14512,Inhaled nitric oxide.,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that induces relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the vasculature. Because NO reacts with oxyhaemoglobin with high affinity, the gas is rapidly scavenged by oxyhaemoglobin in red blood cells and the vasodilating effects of inhaled NO are limited to ventilated regions in the lung. NO therefore has the unique ability to induce pulmonary vasodilatation specifically in the portions of the lung with adequate ventilation, thereby improving oxygenation of blood and decreasing intrapulmonary right to left shunting. Inhaled NO is used to treat a spectrum of cardiopulmonary conditions, including pulmonary hypertension in children and adults. However, the widespread use of inhaled NO is limited by logistical and financial barriers. We have designed, developed and tested a simple and economic NO generation device, which uses pulsed electrical discharges in air to produce therapeutic levels of NO that can be used for inhalation therapy.

However, small molecule-based iron chelators can cause adverse side effects such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, and liver fibrosis. Here we report renal clearable nanochelators for iron overload disorders. First, after a singledose intravenous injection, the nanochelator shows favorable pharmacokinetic properties, such as kidney-specific biodistribution and rapid renal excretion (>80% injected dose in 4 h), compared to native deferoxamine (DFO). Second, subcutaneous (SC) administration of nanochelators improves pharmacodynamics, as evidenced by a 7-fold increase in efficiency of urinary iron excretion compared to intravenous injection. Third, daily SC injections of the nanochelator for 5 days to iron overload mice and rats decrease iron levels in serum and liver. Furthermore, the nanochelator significantly reduces kidney damage caused by iron overload without demonstrating DFO's own nephrotoxicity.

The contrast agents, which improve diagnostic accuracy, are almost exclusively small, hydrophilic gadolinium(III) based chelates. In recent years concerns have arisen surrounding the long-term safety of these compounds, and this has spurred research into alternatives. There has also been a push to develop new molecularly targeted contrast agents or agents that can sense pathological changes in the local environment. This comprehensive review describes the state of the art of clinically approved contrast agents, their mechanism of action, and factors influencing their safety. From there we describe different mechanisms of generating MR image contrast such as relaxation, chemical exchange saturation transfer, and direct detection and the types of molecules that are effective for these purposes. Next we describe efforts to make safer contrast agents either by increasing relaxivity, increasing resistance to metal ion release, or by moving to gadolinium(III)-free alternatives.

30727752,PMC6436974,doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312262,Epigenetic Inheritance Underlying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.,"In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the Warburg effect (glycolytic shift) and mitochondrial fission are determinants of phenotype alterations characteristic of the disease, such as proliferation, apoptosis resistance, migration, endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix stiffness. Current therapies, focusing largely on vasodilation and antithrombotic protection, do not restore these aberrant phenotypes suggesting that additional pathways need be targeted. The multifactorial nature of PAH suggests epigenetic changes as potential determinants of vascular remodeling. Transgenerational epigenetic changes induced by hypoxia can result in permanent changes early in fetal development increasing PAH risk in adulthood. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are pharmacologically reversible, making them an attractive target as therapeutic strategies for PAH. This review offers a landscape of the most current clinical, epigenetic-sensitive changes contributing to PAH vascular remodeling both in early and later life, with a focus on a network medicine strategy. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of the application (from morphogenesis to disease onset) of molecular network-based algorithms to dissect PAH molecular pathobiology. Additionally, we suggest an integrated network-based program for clinical disease gene discovery that may reveal novel biomarkers and novel disease targets, thus offering a truly innovative path toward redefining and treating PAH, as well as facilitating the trajectory of a comprehensive precision medicine approach to PAH.","Adult|Biomarkers|Early Diagnosis|Epigenesis, Genetic|Female|Fetal Hypoxia|Genetic Association Studies|Humans|MicroRNAs|Precision Medicine|Pregnancy|Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects|Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|RNA, Long Noncoding|Risk Factors|Vascular Remodeling|apoptosis|biomarkers|hypoxia|mutation|primary prevention","Napoli, Claudio|Benincasa, Giuditta|Loscalzo, Joseph","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019,2019-04-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

This nucleus is more than a simple relay, however, because rNST neurons differ in response rates and tuning curves relative to primary afferent fibers. To systematically study the impact of convergence and inhibition on firing frequency and breadth of tuning (BOT) in rNST, we constructed a mathematical model of its two major cell types: projection neurons and inhibitory neurons. First, we fit a conductance-based neuronal model to data derived from whole cell patch-clamp recordings of inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons in a mouse expressing Venus under the control of the VGAT promoter. We then used in vivo chorda tympani (CT) taste responses as afferent input to modeled neurons and assessed how the degree and type of convergence influenced model cell output frequency and BOT for comparison with in vivo gustatory responses from the rNST. Finally, we assessed how presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition impacted model cell output. The results of our simulations demonstrated 1) increasing numbers of convergent afferents (2-10) result in a proportional increase in best-stimulus firing frequency but only a modest increase in BOT, 2) convergence of afferent input selected from the same best-stimulus class of CT afferents produced a better fit to real data from the rNST compared with convergence of randomly selected afferent input, and 3) inhibition narrowed the BOT to more realistically model the in vivo rNST data. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro neurophysiology together with conductance-based modeling, we show how patterns of convergence and inhibition interact in the rostral (gustatory) solitary nucleus to maintain signal fidelity. Although increasing convergence led to a systematic increase in firing frequency, tuning specificity was maintained with a pattern of afferent inputs sharing the best-stimulus compared with random inputs. Tonic inhibition further enhanced response fidelity.","Action Potentials|Afferent Pathways|Animals|Chorda Tympani Nerve|GABAergic Neurons|Mice, Transgenic|Models, Neurological|Neural Pathways|Neurons|Solitary Nucleus|Taste|convergence|inhibition|modeling|taste","Boxwell, Alison|Terman, David|Frank, Marion|Yanagawa, Yuchio|Travers, Joseph B",Journal of neurophysiology,2018,2018-03-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

Three GBCAs comprising acyclic Gd chelates, the class of GBCA most prone to Gd release, are no longer marketed in Europe. Of particular concern are the acyclic chelates that remain available for liver scans, where there is an unmet diagnostic need and no replacement technology. To address this concern, we evaluated our previously reported Mn-based MRI contrast agent, Mn-PyC3A, and nine newly synthesized derivatives as liver specific MRI contrast agents.

We developed and analyzed a fibrosis protein-protein network (fibrosome) in silico, which predicted that the SMAD3 target neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) is a critical ALDO-regulated node underpinning pathogenic vascular fibrosis. Bioinformatics and microscale thermophoresis demonstrated that oxidation of Cys<sup>18</sup> in the SMAD3 docking region of NEDD9 impairs SMAD3-NEDD9 protein-protein interactions in vitro. This effect was reproduced by ALDO-induced oxidant stress in cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), resulting in impaired NEDD9 proteolytic degradation, increased NEDD9 complex formation with Nk2 homeobox 5 (NKX2-5), and increased NKX2-5 binding to <i>COL3A1</i> Up-regulation of NEDD9-dependent collagen III expression corresponded to changes in cell stiffness measured by atomic force microscopy. HPAEC-derived exosomal signaling targeted NEDD9 to increase collagen I/III expression in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, identifying a second endothelial mechanism regulating vascular fibrosis. ALDO-NEDD9 signaling was not affected by treatment with a TGF-β ligand trap and, thus, was not contingent on TGF-β signaling. Colocalization of NEDD9 with collagen III in HPAECs was observed in fibrotic pulmonary arterioles from PAH patients. Furthermore, <i>NEDD9</i> ablation or inhibition prevented fibrotic vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in animal models of PAH in vivo. These data identify a critical TGF-β-independent posttranslational modification that impairs SMAD3-NEDD9 binding in HPAECs to modulate vascular fibrosis and promote PAH.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing|Animals|Collagen Type III|Endothelial Cells|Female|Fibrosis|Humans|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Lung|Male|Phosphoproteins|Protein Binding|Pulmonary Artery|Rats|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Smad3 Protein|Systems Biology","Samokhin, Andriy O|Stephens, Thomas|Wertheim, Bradley M|Wang, Rui-Sheng|Vargas, Sara O|Yung, Lai-Ming|Cao, Minwei|Brown, Marcel|Arons, Elena|Dieffenbach, Paul B|Fewell, Jason G|Matar, Majed|Bowman, Frederick P|Haley, Kathleen J|Alba, George A|Marino, Stefano M|Kumar, Rahul|Rosas, Ivan O|Waxman, Aaron B|Oldham, William M|Khanna, Dinesh|Graham, Brian B|Seo, Sachiko|Gladyshev, Vadim N|Yu, Paul B|Fredenburgh, Laura E|Loscalzo, Joseph|Leopold, Jane A|Maron, Bradley A",Science translational medicine,2018,2018-06-13,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
29985917,PMC6053252,doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006292,Gain control with A-type potassium current: IA as a switch between divisive and subtractive inhibition.,"Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two ""modes"" of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if IA is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and IA. Our findings suggest that neurons can ""self-regulate"" the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.","Action Potentials|Animals|Models, Neurological|Neural Inhibition|Neuronal Plasticity|Neurons|Poisson Distribution|Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated|Solitary Nucleus|Synapses|Synaptic Potentials","Goldwyn, Joshua H|Slabe, Bradley R|Travers, Joseph B|Terman, David",PLoS computational biology,2018,2018-07-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

A miniature NO (mini-NO) generator was tested for its ability to produce therapeutic levels (20-80 parts per million (ppm)) of NO, while removing potentially toxic gases and metal particles. We studied healthy 6-month-old New Zealand rabbits weighing 3.4 ± 0.4 kg (mean ± SD, n = 8). Pulmonary hypertension was induced by chemically increasing right ventricular systolic pressure to 28-30 mmHg. The mini-NO generator was placed near the endotracheal tube. Production of NO was triggered by a pediatric airway flowmeter during the first 0.5 s of inspiration. In rabbits with acute pulmonary hypertension, the mini-NO generator produced sufficient NO to induce pulmonary vasodilation. Potentially toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were removed by the Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> scavenger. Metallic particles, released from the electrodes by the electric plasma, were removed by a 0.22 μm filter. While producing 40 ppm NO, the mini-NO generator was cooled by a flow of air (70 ml/min) and the external temperature of the housing did not exceed 31 °C. The mini-NO generator safely produced therapeutic levels of NO from air. The mini-NO generator is an effective and economical approach to producing NO for treating neonatal pulmonary hypertension and will increase the accessibility and therapeutic uses of life-saving NO therapy worldwide.","Administration, Inhalation|Animals|Calcium Hydroxide|Equipment Design|Female|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Inhaled nitric oxide|Male|Metals|Miniaturized nitric oxide generator|Neonatal pulmonary hypertension|Nitric Oxide|Pulsed electrical discharge|Rabbits|Respiratory Therapy|Temperature|Vasodilation|Ventricular Pressure","Yu, Binglan|Ferrari, Michele|Schleifer, Grigorij|Blaesi, Aron H|Wepler, Martin|Zapol, Warren M|Bloch, Donald B",Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2018,2018-05-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Materials and Methods Contrast material-enhanced MR angiography was performed in baboons (Papio anubis; n = 4) by using Mn-PyC3A and Gd-DTPA. Dynamic imaging was performed for 60 minutes following Mn-PyC3A injection to monitor distribution and elimination. Serial blood sampling was performed to quantify manganese and gadolinium plasma clearance by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and to characterize Mn-PyC3A metabolism by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Intravascular contrast enhancement in the abdominal aorta and brachiocephalic artery was quantified by measuring contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) versus muscle at 9 seconds following Mn-PyC3A or Gd-DTPA injection. Plasma pharmacokinetics were modeled with a biexponential function, and data were compared with a paired t test. Results Aorta versus muscle CNR (mean ± standard deviation) with Mn-PyC3A and Gd-DTPA was 476 ± 77 and 538 ± 120, respectively (P = .11). Brachiocephalic artery versus muscle CNR was 524 ± 55 versus 518 ± 140, respectively (P = .95). Mn-PyC3A was eliminated via renal and hepatobiliary excretion with similar pharmacokinetics to Gd-DTPA (area under the curve between 0 and 30 minutes, 20.2 ± 3.1 and 17.0 ± 2.4, respectively; P = .23). High-performance liquid chromatography revealed no evidence of Mn-PyC3A biotransformation. Conclusion Mn-PyC3A enables contrast-enhanced MR angiography with comparable contrast enhancement to gadolinium-based agents and may overcome concerns regarding gadolinium-associated toxicity and retention. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Animals|Aorta, Abdominal|Contrast Media|Female|Gadolinium DTPA|Half-Life|Hepatobiliary Elimination|Image Processing, Computer-Assisted|Kidney|Magnetic Resonance Angiography|Manganese|Organometallic Compounds|Papio|Renal Artery","Gale, Eric M|Wey, Hsiao-Ying|Ramsay, Ian|Yen, Yi-Fen|Sosnovik, David E|Caravan, Peter",Radiology,2018,2018-03-01,"Comparative Study|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Moreover, the imbalance between inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines can have deleterious effects. Here, we demonstrated highly selective blood-filtering devices - antibody-modified conduits (AMCs) - that selectively eliminate multiple specific deleterious cytokines in vitro. AMCs functionalized with antibodies against human vascular endothelial growth factor A or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) selectively eliminated the target cytokines from human blood in vitro and maintained them in reduced states even in the face of ongoing infusion at supraphysiologic rates. We characterized the variables that determine AMC performance, using anti-human TNF-α AMCs to eliminate recombinant human TNF-α.

Connections from the caudal, visceral area of the nucleus (cNST) to the rostral, gustatory zone (rNST) have been described, but the phenotype of cells giving rise to the projection(s) and their distribution among rNST subdivisions are unknown. To determine these characteristics of the intrasolitary pathway, we injected pan-neuronal and floxed AAV viruses into the cNST of mice expressing cre in glutamatergic, GABAergic, or catecholaminergic neurons. Particular attention was paid to the terminal field distribution in rNST subdivisions by simultaneously visualizing P2X2 localized to gustatory afferent terminals. All three phenotypically identified pathways terminated in rNST, with the density greatest for glutamatergic and sparsest for catecholaminergic projections, observations supported by retrograde tracing. Interestingly, cNST neurons had more prominent projections to rNST regions medial and ventral to P2X2 staining, i.e., the medial and ventral subdivisions. In addition, GABAergic neurons projected robustly to the lateral subdivision and adjacent parts of the reticular formation and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Although cNST neurons also projected to the P2X2-rich central subdivision, such projections were sparser. These findings suggest that cNST visceral signals exert stronger excitatory and inhibitory influences on local autonomic and reflex pathways associated with the medial and ventral subdivisions compared to weaker modulation of ascending pathways arising from the central subdivision and ultimately destined for the forebrain.","Animals|Catecholamines|Female|Glutamic Acid|Immunohistochemistry|Male|Mice|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Neural Pathways|Neurons|Neurons, Afferent|Prosencephalon|RRID MMRRC_036778-UCD|RRID: AB_10013483|RRID: AB_2040054|RRID: AB_221569|RRID: AB_2314409|RRID: AB_2315160|RRID: AB_2315161|RRID: AB_390204|RRID: AB_90738|RRID: ISMR_JAX 016963|RRID: ISMR_JAX: 000664|RRID: ISMR_JAX: 007908|RRID: ISMR_JAX: 010802|RRID: ISMR_RBRC09645|RRID:AB_90755|Receptors, Purinergic P2X2|Solitary Nucleus|Taste|gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|intrasolitary|rNST subdivisions|taste|visceral","Travers, Susan|Breza, Joseph|Harley, Jacob|Zhu, JiuLin|Travers, Joseph",The Journal of comparative neurology,2018,2018-10-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DC016112,,,,,,R01,True,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing

A hallmark of this response is the metabolic shift to decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis. We hypothesized that hypoxic responses would include a suppression of mitochondrial gene expression. We determined the effects of hypoxia on TFAM, a key mitochondrial transcription factor, in normal pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Hypoxia decreased gene expression of TFAM and that of its upstream regulator, the transcriptional co-activator PGC1β. Although HIF-1α and HIF-2α pathways both contributed to hypoxia-mediated PGC1β suppression, TFAM suppression was regulated solely by HIF-2α-dependent mechanisms. We found that HIF-2α suppresses TFAM by decreasing c-Myc expression. In addition, we show a role for c-Jun in this pathway, linking HIF-2α with attenuation of c-Jun activation. Taken together, these findings establish a new link between HIF-2α and MAPK-signaling that mediates the adaptive regulation of mitochondrial gene expression under low oxygen tension.","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors|Carrier Proteins|Cell Hypoxia|Cells, Cultured|DNA-Binding Proteins|Endothelial Cells|Endothelial cells|Gene Expression Regulation|Humans|Hypoxia inducible factors|Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit|Mitochondrial Proteins|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc|RNA-Binding Proteins|TFAM|Transcription Factors|c-Jun|c-Myc","Zarrabi, Ali J|Kao, Derrick|Nguyen, Dustin T|Loscalzo, Joseph|Handy, Diane E",Cellular signalling,2017,2017-10-01,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

In this study, we evaluated the impact of respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS), a novel neuromodulatory intervention based on an existing transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation approach, in the modulation of brainstem activity and connectivity in migraine patients. We applied 3T-functional magnetic resonance imaging with improved in-plane spatial resolution (2.62 × 2.62 mm) in episodic migraine (interictal) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls to evaluate brain response to RAVANS (gated to either inhalation or exhalation) and sham stimulation. We further investigated RAVANS modulation of tactile trigeminal sensory afference response in the brainstem using air-puff stimulation directed to the forehead during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with sham and inhalatory-gated RAVANS (iRAVANS), exhalatory-gated RAVANS (eRAVANS) activated an ipsilateral pontomedullary region consistent with nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). During eRAVANS, NTS connectivity was increased to anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex, compared with both sham and iRAVANS, in migraine patients. Increased connectivity was inversely correlated with relative time to the next migraine attack, suggesting clinical relevance to this change in connectivity. Poststimulation effects were also noted immediately after eRAVANS, as we found increased activation in putative pontine serotonergic (ie, nucleus raphe centralis) and noradrenergic (ie, locus coeruleus) nuclei in response to trigeminal sensory afference. Regulation of activity and connectivity of brainstem and cortical regions involved in serotonergic and noradrenergic regulation and pain modulation may constitute an underlying mechanism supporting beneficial clinical outcomes for eRAVANS applied for episodic migraine.",Adult|Brain|Brain Stem|Female|Humans|Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Male|Middle Aged|Migraine Disorders|Pain|Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation|Vagus Nerve|Vagus Nerve Stimulation|Young Adult,"Garcia, Ronald G|Lin, Richard L|Lee, Jeungchan|Kim, Jieun|Barbieri, Riccardo|Sclocco, Roberta|Wasan, Ajay D|Edwards, Robert R|Rosen, Bruce R|Hadjikhani, Nouchine|Napadow, Vitaly",Pain,2017,2017-08-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

We retrieved data from the Thermia online and mobile educational tool, which allows parents to monitor their children's fever and infectious febrile illnesses including influenza. We modeled monthly aggregated influenza-like illness case counts from Thermia users over time and compared them against influenza monthly case counts obtained from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China by using time series regression analysis. We retrieved 44 999 observations from January 2014 through July 2016 from Thermia China. Thermia appeared to predict influenza outbreaks 1 month earlier than the National Health and Family Planning Commission influenza surveillance system (P = .046). Being younger, not having up-to-date immunizations, and having an underlying health condition were associated with participant-reported influenza-like illness. Digital health applications could supplement traditional influenza surveillance systems in China by providing access to consumers' symptom reporting. Growing popularity and use of commercial digital health applications in China potentially affords opportunities to support disease detection and monitoring and rapid treatment mobilization.","Adolescent|Adult|Aged|Child|Child, Preschool|China|Communicable Diseases|Disease Outbreaks|Early Diagnosis|Humans|Infant|Infant, Newborn|Influenza, Human|Middle Aged|Population Surveillance|Software","Hswen, Yulin|Brownstein, John S|Liu, Jeremiah|Hawkins, Jared B",American journal of public health,2017,2017-07-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
27861257,PMC5432394,doi:10.1097/SHK.0000000000000797,Pulmonary Phototherapy to Treat Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in Rats.,"Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a common cause of poison-related mortality. CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), impairing oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Current treatment of CO-poisoned patients involves oxygen administration to rapidly remove CO and restore oxygen delivery. Light dissociates CO from COHb with high efficiency. Exposure of murine lungs to visible laser-generated light improved the CO elimination rate in vivo. The aims of this study were to apply pulmonary phototherapy to a larger animal model of CO poisoning, to test novel approaches to light delivery, and to examine the effect of chemiluminescence-generated light on the CO elimination rate. Anesthetized and mechanically ventilated rats were poisoned with CO and subsequently treated with air or oxygen combined with or without pulmonary phototherapy delivered directly to the lungs of animals at thoracotomy, via intrapleural optical fibers or generated by a chemiluminescent reaction. Direct pulmonary phototherapy dissociated CO from COHb reducing COHb half-life by 38%. Early treatment with phototherapy in critically CO poisoned rats improved lactate clearance. Light delivered to the lungs of rats via intrapleural optical fibers increased the rate of CO elimination without requiring a thoracotomy, as demonstrated by a 16% reduction in COHb half-life. Light generated in the pleural spaces by a chemiluminescent reaction increased the rate of CO elimination in rats breathing oxygen, reducing the COHb half-life by 12%. Successful application of pulmonary phototherapy in larger animals and humans may represent a significant advance in the treatment of CO-poisoned patients.","Androstanols|Animals|Blood Pressure|Body Temperature|Carbon Monoxide|Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|Carotid Arteries|Disease Models, Animal|Fentanyl|Heart Rate|Hemoglobins|Injections, Intraperitoneal|Ketamine|Luminescence|Male|Phototherapy|Rats|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Rocuronium|Tracheotomy","Zazzeron, Luca|Liu, Chen|Franco, Walfre|Nakagawa, Akito|Farinelli, William A|Bloch, Donald B|Anderson, Richard Rox|Zapol, Warren M","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",2017,2017-06-01,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
28685297,,doi:10.1007/s11095-017-2222-3,Hemodynamic Effects of Lipid-Based Oxygen Microbubbles via Rapid Intravenous Injection in Rodents.,"Low oxygen levels, or hypoxemia, is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Hypoxemia is typically addressed by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen, the use of mechanical ventilation, or more invasive measures. Recently, the injection of oxygen gas directly into the bloodstream by packaging it within lipid-based oxygen microbubbles (LOMs) has been explored. The purpose of this work is to examine the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous injections of LOMs. LOMs composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline and cholesterol were manufactured using a process of shear homogenization under an oxygen headspace. A 5 mL aliquot of either PlasmaLyte A, or low (37%) or high (55%) concentration LOMs (n = 10 per group) was injected over a 1 min period into Sprague Dawley rats instrumented for measurement of cardiac index and pulmonary (PVR) and systemic (SVR) vascular resistance during a 60 min observation period. Hemodynamics were compared between groups by linear mixed modeling. Approximately 10<sup>11</sup> LOMs with mean diameter 3.77 ± 1.19 μm were injected over the 1 min period. Relative to controls, rodents treated with high concentration LOMs exhibited a higher pulmonary artery pressure (20 ± 0.4 mmHg vs 18 ± 0.4 mmHg, P < 0.001) and higher PVR (0.31 ± 0.01 vs 0.23 ± 0.01 mmHg/mL*min*kg, P < 0.001. Despite a stable cardiac index (62.2 ± 3.5 vs 62.3 ± 3.4 mL/min*kg, P < 0.001), mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly in LOM-treated animals (46 ± 2 vs 60 ± 2 mmHg, P < 0.001) due to a decrease in SVR. Injections with aged LOM emulsions (>48 h since manufacture) resulted in a higher incidence of hemodynamic collapse during the observation period (P = 0.02). LOMs may be injected in quantities sufficient to deliver clinically meaningful volumes of oxygen but cause significant decrements in blood pressure and elevations in PVR.","Animals|Blood Pressure|Cholesterol|Hemodynamics|Humans|Hypoxia|Injections, Intravenous|Male|Microbubbles|Oxygen|Particle Size|Phosphatidylcholines|Pulmonary Artery|Rats|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Respiration, Artificial|Surface Properties|Vascular Resistance|hemodynamics|hypoxia|microbubble|oxygen|phospholipid","Black, Katherine J|Lock, Andrew T|Thomson, Lindsay M|Cole, Alexis R|Tang, Xiaoqi|Polizzotti, Brian D|Kheir, John N",Pharmaceutical research,2017,2017-10-01,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

The RVED is designed for safe and effective intracardiac operation and consists of an anchoring system deployed across the IVS, an RV free wall anchor, and a pneumatic artificial muscle linear actuator that spans the RV chamber between the two anchors. Using a ventricular simulator and a custom controller, we characterized ventricular volume ejection, linear approximation against different loads and the effect of varying device actuation periods on volume ejection. The RVED was then tested in vivo in adult pigs (n = 5). First, we successfully deployed the device into the beating heart under 3D echocardiography guidance (n = 4). Next, we performed a feasibility study to evaluate the device's ability to augment RV ejection in an experimental model of RHF (n = 1). RVED actuation augmented RV ejection during RHF; while further chronic animal studies will provide details about the efficacy of this support device. These results demonstrate successful design and implementation of the RVED and its deployment into the beating heart. This soft robotic ejection device has potential to serve as a rapidly deployable system for mechanical circulatory assistance in RHF.","Animals|Disease Models, Animal|Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional|Female|Heart Failure|Humans|Mechanical circulatory support|Right heart failure|Robotics|Soft robotics|Stroke Volume|Swine","Horvath, Markus A|Wamala, Isaac|Rytkin, Eric|Doyle, Elizabeth|Payne, Christopher J|Thalhofer, Thomas|Berra, Ignacio|Solovyeva, Anna|Saeed, Mossab|Hendren, Sara|Roche, Ellen T|Del Nido, Pedro J|Walsh, Conor J|Vasilyev, Nikolay V",Annals of biomedical engineering,2017,2017-09-01,Journal Article,HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

This precludes many higher-risk (acute ischemic and acute stroke) patients from undergoing MRI and MRI-guided intervention. An MRI-conditional cardiac defibrillator should enable scanning with defibrillation pads attached and the generator ON, enabling application of defibrillation within the seconds of MRI after a cardiac event. An MRI-conditional external defibrillator may improve patient acceptance for MRI procedures. A commercial external defibrillator was rendered 1.5 Tesla MRI-conditional by the addition of novel radiofrequency filters between the generator and commercial disposable surface pads. The radiofrequency filters reduced emission into the MRI scanner and prevented cable/surface pad heating during imaging, while preserving all the defibrillator monitoring and delivery functions. Human volunteers were imaged using high specific absorption rate sequences to validate MRI image quality and lack of heating. Swine were electrically fibrillated (n=4) and thereafter defibrillated both outside and inside the MRI bore. MRI image quality was reduced by 0.8 or 1.6 dB, with the generator in monitoring mode and operating on battery or AC power, respectively. Commercial surface pads did not create artifacts deeper than 6 mm below the skin surface. Radiofrequency heating was within US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Defibrillation was completely successful inside and outside the MRI bore. A prototype MRI-conditional defibrillation system successfully defibrillated in the MRI without degrading the image quality or increasing the time needed for defibrillation. It can increase patient acceptance for MRI procedures.","Animals|Defibrillators|Disease Models, Animal|Electric Countershock|Equipment Design|Heart Arrest|Humans|Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Materials Testing|Resuscitation|Sus scrofa|Time-to-Treatment|artifacts|cardiopulmonary resuscitation|defibrillators|magnetic resonance imaging|stroke","Schmidt, Ehud J|Watkins, Ronald D|Zviman, Menekhem M|Guttman, Michael A|Wang, Wei|Halperin, Henry A",Circulation.

27791101,PMC5098671,doi:10.1073/pnas.1608438113,Oxygen delivery using engineered microparticles.,"A continuous supply of oxygen to tissues is vital to life and interruptions in its delivery are poorly tolerated. The treatment of low-blood oxygen tensions requires restoration of functional airways and lungs. Unfortunately, severe oxygen deprivation carries a high mortality rate and can make otherwise-survivable illnesses unsurvivable. Thus, an effective and rapid treatment for hypoxemia would be revolutionary. The i.v. injection of oxygen bubbles has recently emerged as a potential strategy to rapidly raise arterial oxygen tensions. In this report, we describe the fabrication of a polymer-based intravascular oxygen delivery agent. Polymer hollow microparticles (PHMs) are thin-walled, hollow polymer microcapsules with tunable nanoporous shells. We show that PHMs are easily charged with oxygen gas and that they release their oxygen payload only when exposed to desaturated blood. We demonstrate that oxygen release from PHMs is diffusion-controlled, that they deliver approximately five times more oxygen gas than human red blood cells (per gram), and that they are safe and effective when injected in vivo. Finally, we show that PHMs can be stored at room temperature under dry ambient conditions for at least 2 mo without any effect on particle size distribution or gas carrying capacity.","Animals|Capsules|Drug Delivery Systems|Drug Liberation|Humans|Injections, Intravenous|Kinetics|Male|Nanopores|Oxygen|Particle Size|Polymers|Porosity|Rats, Sprague-Dawley|Reproducibility of Results|colloids|core–shell|hypoxemia|microparticle|oxygen","Seekell, Raymond P|Lock, Andrew T|Peng, Yifeng|Cole, Alexis R|Perry, Dorothy A|Kheir, John N|Polizzotti, Brian D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2016,2016-11-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
27006450,PMC4904292,doi:10.1096/fj.201500042,Up-regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 subunit Raptor by aldosterone induces abnormal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell survival patterns to promote pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) subunit Raptor induces cell growth and is a downstream target of Akt. Elevated levels of aldosterone activate Akt, and, in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), correlate with pulmonary arteriole thickening, which suggests that mTORC1 regulation by aldosterone may mediate adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling. We hypothesized that aldosterone-Raptor signaling induces abnormal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) survival patterns to promote PAH. Remodeled pulmonary arterioles from SU-5416/hypoxia-PAH rats and monocrotaline-PAH rats with hyperaldosteronism expressed increased levels of the Raptor target, p70S6K, which provided a basis for investigating aldosterone-Raptor signaling in human PASMCs. Aldosterone (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) increased Akt/mTOR/Raptor to activate p70S6K and increase proliferation, viability, and apoptosis resistance in PASMCs. In PASMCs transfected with Raptor-small interfering RNA or treated with spironolactone/eplerenone, aldosterone or pulmonary arterial plasma from patients with PAH failed to increase p70S6K activation or to induce cell survival in vitro Optimal inhibition of pulmonary arteriole Raptor was achieved by treatment with Staramine-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol that was formulated with Raptor-small interfering RNA plus spironolactone in vivo, which decreased arteriole muscularization and pulmonary hypertension in 2 experimental animal models of PAH in vivo Up-regulation of mTORC1 by aldosterone is a critical pathobiologic mechanism that controls PASMC survival to promote hypertrophic vascular remodeling and PAH.-Aghamohammadzadeh, R., Zhang, Y.-Y., Stephens, T.

27278246,PMC4899691,doi:10.1038/srep27414,Endophenotype Network Models: Common Core of Complex Diseases.,"Historically, human diseases have been differentiated and categorized based on the organ system in which they primarily manifest. Recently, an alternative view is emerging that emphasizes that different diseases often have common underlying mechanisms and shared intermediate pathophenotypes, or endo(pheno)types. Within this framework, a specific disease's expression is a consequence of the interplay between the relevant endophenotypes and their local, organ-based environment. Important examples of such endophenotypes are inflammation, fibrosis, and thrombosis and their essential roles in many developing diseases. In this study, we construct endophenotype network models and explore their relation to different diseases in general and to cardiovascular diseases in particular. We identify the local neighborhoods (module) within the interconnected map of molecular components, i.e., the subnetworks of the human interactome that represent the inflammasome, thrombosome, and fibrosome. We find that these neighborhoods are highly overlapping and significantly enriched with disease-associated genes. In particular they are also enriched with differentially expressed genes linked to cardiovascular disease (risk). Finally, using proteomic data, we explore how macrophage activation contributes to our understanding of inflammatory processes and responses. The results of our analysis show that inflammatory responses initiate from within the cross-talk of the three identified endophenotypic modules.",Cardiovascular Diseases|Endophenotypes|Fibrosis|Gene Regulatory Networks|Humans|Inflammasomes|Inflammation|Proteomics|Thrombosis,"Ghiassian, Susan Dina|Menche, Jörg|Chasman, Daniel I|Giulianini, Franco|Wang, Ruisheng|Ricchiuto, Piero|Aikawa, Masanori|Iwata, Hiroshi|Müller, Christian|Zeller, Tania|Sharma, Amitabh|Wild, Philipp|Lackner, Karl|Singh, Sasha|Ridker, Paul M|Blankenberg, Stefan|Barabási, Albert-László|Loscalzo, Joseph",Scientific reports,2016,2016-06-09,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

However, the current NO/N<sub>2</sub> cylinder delivery system is cumbersome and expensive. We developed a lightweight, portable, and economical device to generate NO from air by pulsed electrical discharge. The objective of this study was to investigate and optimize the purity and safety of NO generated by this device. By using low temperature streamer discharges in the plasma generator, we produced therapeutic levels of NO with very low levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone. Despite the low temperature, spark generation eroded the surface of the electrodes, contaminating the gas stream with metal particles. During prolonged NO generation there was gradual loss of the iridium high-voltage tip (-90 μg/day) and the platinum-nickel ground electrode (-55 μg/day). Metal particles released from the electrodes were trapped by a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Quadrupole mass spectroscopy measurements of effluent gas during plasma NO generation showed that a single HEPA filter removed all of the metal particles. Mice were exposed to breathing 50 parts per million of electrically generated NO in air for 28 days with only a scavenger and no HEPA filter; the mice did not develop pulmonary inflammation or structural changes and iridium and platinum particles were not detected in the lungs of these mice. In conclusion, an electric plasma generator produced therapeutic levels of NO from air; scavenging and filtration effectively eliminated metallic impurities from the effluent gas.","Administration, Inhalation|Air Filters|Air Pollutants|Animals|Drug Contamination|Electrodes|Filtration|Iridium|Iridium electrode|Lung|Male|Metal particles|Metals, Heavy|Mice|Mice, Inbred C57BL|Nitric Oxide|Nitric oxide|Pulsed electrical discharge|Temperature","Yu, Binglan|Blaesi, Aron H|Casey, Noel|Raykhtsaum, Grigory|Zazzeron, Luca|Jones, Rosemary|Morrese, Alexander|Dobrynin, Danil|Malhotra, Rajeev|Bloch, Donald B|Goldstein, Lee E|Zapol, Warren M",Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2016,2016-11-30,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Here we applied this approach in vivo to the anemia drug erythropoietin (EPO), to direct its activity to EPO receptors (EPO-Rs) on red blood cell (RBC) precursors and prevent interaction with EPO-Rs on nonerythroid cells, such as platelets. Our engineered EPO molecule was mutated to weaken its affinity for EPO-R, but its avidity for RBC precursors was rescued via tethering to an antibody fragment that specifically binds the human RBC marker glycophorin A (huGYPA). We systematically tested the impact of these engineering steps on in vivo markers of efficacy, side effects, and pharmacokinetics. huGYPA transgenic mice dosed with targeted EPO exhibited elevated RBC levels, with only minimal platelet effects. This in vivo selectivity depended on the weakening EPO mutation, fusion to the RBC-specific antibody, and expression of huGYPA. The terminal plasma half-life of targeted EPO was ∼28.3 h in transgenic mice vs. ∼15.5 h in nontransgenic mice, indicating that huGYPA on mature RBCs acted as a significant drug sink but did not inhibit efficacy. In a therapeutic context, our targeting approach may allow higher restorative doses of EPO without platelet-mediated side effects, and also may improve drug pharmacokinetics. These results demonstrate how rational drug design can improve in vivo specificity, with potential application to diverse protein therapeutics.","Anemia|Animals|Drug Design|Erythropoiesis|Erythropoietin|Humans|Mice|Mice, Transgenic|Molecular Targeted Therapy|Protein Engineering|Receptors, Erythropoietin|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Treatment Outcome|drug targeting|platelet|protein engineering|scFv","Burrill, Devin R|Vernet, Andyna|Collins, James J|Silver, Pamela A|Way, Jeffrey C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2016,2016-05-10,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Our aim was to determine the role of NFkB in SAH-induced activation of endothelial cells. Furthermore, we examined whether SAH, as a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, suppresses the function of EZH2 methyltransferase to contribute to SAH-induced endothelial cell activation. We found that excess SAH increases the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Importantly, this up-regulation was suppressed in cells expressing a dominant negative form of the NFkB inhibitor, IkB. Moreover, SAH accumulation triggers the activation of both the canonical and non-canonical NFkB pathways, decreases EZH2, and reduces histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation. EZH2 knockdown recapitulated the effects of excess SAH on endothelial activation, i.e., it induced NFkB activation and the subsequent up-regulation of adhesion molecules and cytokines. Our findings suggest that suppression of the epigenetic regulator EZH2 by excess SAH may contribute to NFkB activation and the consequent vascular inflammatory response. These studies unveil new targets of SAH regulation, demonstrating that EZH2 suppression and NFkB activation mediated by SAH accumulation may contribute to its adverse effects in the vasculature.",Adhesion molecules|Cell Line|EZH2|Endothelial Cells|Endothelial activation|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein|Humans|Inflammation|Methylation|Methyltransferases|NF-kappa B|NFkB|S-Adenosylhomocysteine|S-Adenosylmethionine|S-adenosylhomocysteine,"Barroso, Madalena|Kao, Derrick|Blom, Henk J|Tavares de Almeida, Isabel|Castro, Rita|Loscalzo, Joseph|Handy, Diane E",Biochimica et biophysica acta,2016,2016-01-01,"Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL119145,,,,,,U54,False,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC

Specifically, recent work has uncovered the role of miRNAs in controlling the levels of atherogenic low-density lipoprotein LDL (LDL)-cholesterol by post-transcriptionally regulating genes involved in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, cholesterol biosynthesis, and hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) expression. Interestingly, several of these miRNAs are located in genomic loci associated with abnormal levels of circulating lipids in humans. These findings reinforce the interest of targeting this subset of non-coding RNAs as potential therapeutic avenues for regulating plasma cholesterol and triglyceride (TAG) levels. In this review, we will discuss how these new miRNAs represent potential pre-disposition factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and putative therapeutic targets in patients with cardiometabolic disorders.
