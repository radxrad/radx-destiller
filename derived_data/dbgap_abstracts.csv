1U01HL152410-01,phs002522.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,HL152410,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): MOF-SCENT: Metal-Organic Frameworks for Screening COVID-19 by Electronic-Nose Technology to Improve Selectivity and Time Response,COVID-19,"This proposal describes the design, fabrication, and proof-of-concept testing of a novel MOF-SCENT system (Metal-Organic Frameworks for Screening COVID-19 by Electronic-Nose Technology) that features the following advantages: (1) Highly selective and sensitive detection of a variety of VOCs; (2) fast response and recovery time; (3) portable, low-cost, robust, easy-to-use, and deployable in any clinical, community, and everyday setting. The proposed accurate, sensitive, low-cost, robust, and portable MOF-SCENT system provides a realistic approach to dramatically increase testing capacity for COVID-19 because it can be rapidly integrated into and adopted by the public and healthcare systems by deploying a large number of such systems at central facilities (e.g., airports, shopping malls), point-of-care sites (e.g., hospitals, pharmacies, urgent care centers), and workplaces and even homes. The manufacturing of the MOF-SCENT system can be easily scaled to &gt; 50,000 units because the simple design can be fabricated out of stainless steel in common machine shops and the MOF material is commercially available or can be synthesized in organic synthesis laboratories. The detector of the MOF-SCENT system could be manufactured based on existing portable vector network analyzer (VNA) interrogators (new VNA technology called MN7021A RF Sensor., Keysight Technologies, Santa Rosa, CA). Commercially-available VNAs would be stripped down to increase production output and reduce costs (Keysight Technologies can head up the effort to mass-produce the interrogators). Capital costs for the production ramp-up of large numbers of MOF-SCENT systems are minimal because existing machine shops and Keysight Technologies' electronic assembly infrastructure would be used. Installation of the MOF-SCENT system at homes, grocery stores, pharmacies, and medical clinics will significantly increase daily accessibility to on-demand accurate testing and thereby mitigate the second wave of infections of SARS-CoV-2. Keysight Technologies is the world's largest test and measurement manufacturer, with a well-established supply chain, superior logistics and technical support infrastructure, and a commitment to quality control."

With the over 5,000 patients who have been recruited in our original Phase 1 IRB-approved study, we will further optimize our algorithms, especially on its application in individuals with diverse ethnic backgrounds (Aim 1). We will further integrate and optimize MyPHD and COH to enable real-time online detection of COVID-19 (Aim 2). We will deploy MyPHD/COH on the different concentrated populations including pediatric kidney transplant patients, Pac-12 student athletes, and senior living residents (Aim 3)."
1R01DE031114-01,phs002524.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance,DE031114,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Validation of Smart Masks for Surveillance of COVID-19,COVID-19,"Vulnerable populations do not just need testing - they need surveillance. The ideal surveillance tool would operate in the background with minimal involvement of the population to be tested; it would be simple, affordable, reliable, and accurate. Unfortunately, no such assay yet exists. Here, we propose a ""smart mask"" that changes colors when the wearer has been exposed to biomarkers (proteases) of COVID-19. This is a novel approach to surveillance because most people are already wearing masks - especially in high-risk settings. Our first goal is to optimize the reagents that will test the proteases. We will customize the peptide sequences such that the reagents change color only when two key SARS proteases are present. After characterizing the colorimetric reagents, Aim 2 will integrate these reagents into an adhesive test strip that can be affixed to any existing cloth or surgical mask. Aim 3 is validation with human subjects. First, we will use biobanked saliva samples that are confirmed to be either COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative. Next, we will evaluate how long people infected with SARS-CoV-2 must breathe through the smart mask before it changes colors. Finally, we will use the smart mask for surveillance of a population that is concurrently being tested regularly via PCR. We will calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the smart masks through comparison to PCR. We will measure true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and estimate needing 800 subjects, which is very feasible at our institution."

UM has deployed an elaborate human surveillance testing, tracking and tracing (3T) system to monitor the student body, faculty, and staff. This 3T system includes a major hospital that is part of UM and that treats COVID-19 patients. To augment this COVID-19 monitoring system, UM has deployed a pilot wastewater surveillance program for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from clusters of buildings on campus. Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) is located in New York City, NY, an area that until recently had one of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19. WCM has established an international consortium for SARS-CoV-2 environmental surveillance, including in NYC and globally with the MetaSUB Consortium, which is creating metagenomic and metatranscriptomic maps of the world&#39;s sewage. Based on this work at both UM and WCM, this proposal aims to develop, implement, and demonstrate effective and predictive wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling, concentration, and detection strategies. Working closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), this application (SF-RAD) will develop and implement data standards and informatics infrastructure and perform integrative analyses to make all data, results, and models available to the community, thus providing a critical contribution to the national SARS-COV-2 RADx-rad Wastewater Detection Consortium. Our objectives will be addressed through three aims. Aim 1: Data Standardization, focuses on developing and implementing data standards and quality metrics, and establishing the operational infrastructure to manage SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based surveillance datasets and metadata. Aim 2: Wastewater Characterization, focuses on optimizing wastewater surveillance protocols and parameters for wastewater sampling, sample concentration, and viral detection technologies. Aim 3: Integration with Human Health Surveillance, focuses on metatranscriptomic analyses and on the integration of wastewater quantification data with community and hospital COVID-19 prevalence, to develop predictive models to detect local and community level spread of COVID-19. All data will be made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) in close collaboration with the DCC, and will be collected and managed with attention to ethical issues in surveillance and data management, including efforts to ensure research rigor and reproducibility. The results from this proposal will develop and deploy experimental and informatics infrastructure and operations as part of the national RADx-rad SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance network and will provide a proof-of-concept implementation to use wastewater for infectious disease surveillance for early detection of localized COVID-19 outbreaks."
3U01LM013129-02S1,phs002527.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Wastewater,LM013129,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Bioinformatics Framework for Wastewater-based Surveillance of Infectious Diseases,COVID-19,"COVID-19 is expected to become one of the largest mass casualty events in the history of the United States (U.S.). Assessment of the true burden of disease in the population is needed for the prevention and mitigation of this and future viral disease outbreaks. Currently, testing of new cases (via swabs / saliva) and those previously exposed (via serum) has limited reach in the population. However, an alternative approach relying on the analysis of community wastewater can screen up to 70% of the U.S. population on a weekly basis at &lt;0.01% of the cost of clinical screening of individuals. As a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to complement current surveillance methods to better understand disease burden and how these burdens differ across communities. The goal of our proposed RADx-rad supplement is to implement and evaluate a near real-time WBE framework for SARS-CoV-2 by (i) assessing in near real-time community spread of the new coronavirus, (ii) significantly increasing the fraction of the U.S. population screened, the frequency at which this testing is being completed (weekly) and the geospatial resolution of screening (from city-wide to neighborhood-specific), (iii) comparing novel coronavirus levels in wastewater with the burdens of infection, disease and mortality reported by local health systems, (iv) harvesting high throughput sequence (HTS) data on SARS-CoV-2 variants across the U.S., (v) optimizing pipelines for HTS analysis, and (vi) immediately sharing any new knowledge gained with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), research community, and the general public via an expansion of our online dashboard that was pioneered by the proposing team in collaboration with the City of Tempe, AZ. We will leverage previously developed, peer-reviewed strategies for population-wide virus monitoring via reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), HTS, sequence analysis, and data communication originally developed for our parent award to quickly provide a data stream and scientific resource for managing the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. In Aim 1, develop a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) bioinformatics framework for SARS-CoV-2 at the national, city and intra-sewershed or neighborhood-level to produce RT-qPCR and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data for studying the distribution of viral levels and genetic polymorphisms in the community. In Aim 2, we will evaluate a WBE bioinformatics framework for translating SARS-CoV-2 data from RT-qPCR and high-throughput sequencing into information for monitoring population health. Successful completion of this biomedical informatics project will provide the U.S. with an early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 detection and a tracking aid for public health epidemiologists seeking to reduce morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases like COVID-19 in the U.S."

Wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-2 in rural communities using field-friendly technology will provide important information to local authorities and citizens about the spread and trend of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their communities. Our project will accomplish two aims: 1) Develop next generation wastewater assessment technology and 2) Implement and evaluate the next generation wastewater assay. For Aim 1 we adapt technology invented by our team termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP) to simplify and improve RNA extraction from wastewater. We will pair ESP with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology for RNA detection to create a sensitive, robust, and field-friendly platform for testing wastewater for SARSCoV-2 RNA. We will compare the next generation assay with established techniques on metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and usability (e.g., assay time, number of assay steps). For Aim 2 we will first validate the next generation assay in the field at congregate living facilities in a side-by-side comparison with conventional wastewater surveillance. Next, building on existing relationships in Eastern Kentucky, we will recruit and train a purposive group of wastewater treatment plant operators, watershed watch citizen scientists, and school science teachers to test wastewater in their communities and schools using the field-friendly next generation wastewater assay. Field results will be validated in the lab. A robust mixed methods evaluation using the RE-AIM framework will assess community perceptions of feasibility, acceptability, and utility of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and identify community measures taken in response to test results."

The objective in this proposal is to build a touch-screen sensor array to directly capture, detect, and identify model SARS-CoV-2 virus particles with minimal false alarms. This ambitious goal will be achieved by the interdisciplinary team of GE Research scientists and engineers and will be a synergistic combination of the proposed innovations and the prior scientific and engineering accomplishments of the team."

The applicant's group is a grantee in the NIH Common Fund ""Extraceullar RNA Communication (ERC)"" Program advancing a new and emerging technology of Acoustofluidic Separation (AFS) for label-free, high yield and purity exosomes from biofluids which is coupled to extracellular RNA characterization using Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for single EV identification. This U18 application is to reposition the AFS EV technology and SERS for the earliest non-invasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 and host immunity in saliva of infected patients."
1U01AA029328-01,phs002546.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing,AA029328,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Development of an Automated Diagnostic Platform for SARS-CoV-2 Monitoring in Vulnerable Areas,COVID-19,"The devastation caused by emerging pathogens with fast transmission capacity, such as SARS-CoV-2, has demonstrated the importance of preparedness for future viral outbreaks; this includes the ability for fast deployment of in-situ testing tools and epidemiological surveillance with high temporal and spatial resolution; particularly in places that are most vulnerable to becoming reservoirs of infectious agents. We propose to develop a versatile multiplexing detection platform for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The proposed system will integrate signals from different biorecognition elements. Aptamer, antibody, and ACE2 will be immobilized onto laser inscribed graphene electrodes, and detection mechanisms targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein will be studied under varying testing conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength). After determining the operating conditions for enhanced performance of each biosensor, a self-referencing approach will be used between complementary recognition elements (i.e., possible combinations of aptamers, antibodies, and ACE2 enzyme biosensors) to evaluate the effects on test results accuracy (i.e., risk of false-positive and false-negative results). A saliva pre-treatment protocol will be developed to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 testing in human saliva using the multiplex biosensor platform. An open channel microfluidics system will be designed to automatically split and channel a single saliva sample into multiple streams to the biosensors without saturation, biofouling, and pump requirement. The development of a functional and reliable multiplex biosensor system will be useful for addressing longstanding needs in public health as the respiratory coronavirus family continues its seasonal visits, which may repeat over several decades, much like the occasional visits from the influenza virus, with varying degrees of virulence."
1R61HD105610-01,phs002549.v1.p1,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds,HD105610,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Severity Predictors Using Immunology and Transcriptomics in Saliva Using Multi Neural Network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 Infection in Children (SPITS MISC),COVID-19,"Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic."
1R44DE030841-01,phs002550.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC,DE030841,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Direct Bioelectronic Detection of SARS-CoV-2 From Saliva Using Singlemolecule Field-effect Transistor Array,COVID-19,"Nucleic acid test-standard for diagnostics testing for COVID-19, usually performed in specialized laboratories. Most are based on reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The time required for specimen transport and processing results in a turnaround time that is typically several days. The few rapid (&lt;1hour) point-of-care (POC) tests are more expensive, still require sample preparation and specialized reagents, and do not have the throughput needed for population surveillance. Direct testing for the virus, which also reduces requirements for multiple reagents, is a necessary step to improving diagnostic testing. While four such antigen tests have been approved for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on immunoassays to the N protein, sensitivity is limited and no quantitation of viral load is possible.We will address this gap by using Diagnostic (TM), an in-development rapid POC platform for direct, real-time, multiplexed, quantitative bioelectronic detection of biomolecules that employs an all-electronic detection device that functions at the single-molecule level. These single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) are arrayed on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit chip. Chips will interface with an envisioned USB-stick-form-factor reader device. Robust single-domain antibodies, known as nano bodies and immobilized on these devices, are used for sensitive detection of viral particles and viral debris. The use of multiple nanonodies for a single protein and nano bodies for different proteins in a single assay allows for significant improvements in specificity. Nanobodies will be specific for one or more of the four major structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2: the nucleocapsids (N) protein engulfing the final RNA, the spike (S) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. No sample preparation or specialized reagents are required for detection, and the device will be designed to operate with saliva, which has very recently been shown be a reliable medium for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Individual sensor chips can be manufactured at a cost of $35. With the addition of other nanobodies, these large dense arrays can also allow detection of many pathogens in a single test.In this Direct-to-Phase SBIR program we will pursue several key innovations that are required to make such a platform possible, including isolation of nano bodies for key structure proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Specific Aim 1), development of the smFET platform for antigen detection (Specific Aim2), development of large CMOS arrays of these smFET devices (Specific Aim 3), and verification of detection in increasingly complex samples up to and including clinical samples (Specific Aim 4). This project is a partnership between university researchers who developed the smFET technology and a venture-based start-up venture, Quicksilver Biosciences, spun out to commercialize smFET technology and develop smFET/CMOS arrays for molecule diagnosis applications."
1R01MD016526-01,phs002551.v1.p1,RADx-rad,Multimodal Surveillance,MD016526,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Marshallese: Alternate Surveillance for COVID-19 in a Unique Population,COVID-19,"Marshallese Pacific Islanders bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death, with rates 4 to 25 times higher than those of other US racial and ethnic groups in the Continental US. For example, in Northwest Arkansas Marshallese people represent less than 3% of the total population, but they account for 1 out of 5 COVID-19 cases in this area. Similarly, Marshallese represent just 1% of the population in Spokane County, Washington, but were nearly 30% of COVID-19 cases between March and May, 2020. Social determinants of health have powerful influences on community and individual risks for COVID-19.18 Culturally, the Marshallese community is extremely tight-knit, self-contained, and highly clustered; they often live in multi-generational households; and they traditionally value close contact and large social events, all of which increase vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic. Marshallese are important recipients of effective surveillance efforts given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on this population and the long-standing disparities in health and health care. The MASC-UP study will generate novel data that reflect variation in risk of COVID-19 infection based on one's place in the highly clustered Marshallese community. For Specific Aim 1, bilingual Marshallese Community Health Workers will recruit and train a longitudinal cohort of 800 Marshallese adults, ages 18 and older, in participatory disease surveillance methods that include using a wireless thermometer to continuously track body temperature; social media and text messaging in which participants (aka citizen scientists) can report symptoms; and a CHW helpline to report symptoms and request COVID-19 information. Participatory disease surveillance complements traditional surveillance systems by engaging communities in reporting COVID-19 symptoms and events. Its strengths lie in the speed at which data can be made available, the ability to scale the technology to obtain data at low cost, and the ability to cover populations that might not otherwise be tracked. For Specific Aim 2 participants will complete an ego-centric contact survey to characterize the social contact networks of members in the disease surveillance cohort from Aim 1. The networks will allow identification of people at highest risk of COVID-19 infection and elucidate targets for high-impact preventive intervention. For Specific Aim 3 we will integrate findings from Aims 1 and 2 into the existing test-based disease surveillance currently being performed at the state and local levels. This Aim will augment existing surveillance systems that have proved insufficient to stem the pandemic in Marshallese people. The proposed study will be generalizable to other high risk, clustered underserved populations."

The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients, nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the U.K. (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and relate clinical parameters of antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on: aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the [RADx-rad hub](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-rad) to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data have been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 illnesses.

The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) represents the most important method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at its early stage of infection and before the appearance of clinical symptoms. However, qPCR-based molecular diagnostics are bulky, expensive, lab-based, and require trained personnel for system operation. The majority of the FDA EUA-approved COVID-19 diagnostics are PCR-based, which require nucleic acid extraction, followed by amplification via thermal cycling. Such systems also require relatively expensive/bulky equipment for sample processing. Recent studies have shown large, up to 10,000-fold variations, in the limit of detection (LoD) of some of the nucleic acid-based and antigen-based COVID-19 diagnostics currently approved under emergency use authorization (EUA). Therefore, there is still a need to develop Point of Care (POC) diagnostics, and particularly antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices, with LoD comparable to PCR-based assays. The main goal of this interdisciplinary project is to develop a portable diagnostic system for rapid and sensitive detection of intact SARS-CoV-2 in low-volume COVID-19 patient samples, such as anterior/nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples, using an inexpensive, disposable, and mass-producible microfluidic cartridge."

Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for curbing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours to days to obtain results. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results. The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping target volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with a solvent and then analyzed using a portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures VOCs in exhaled breath, and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of the captured VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that VOC metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body&#39;s reaction to tSARS-CoV-2 infection, and the changes of VOC profile in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI&#39;s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team&#39;s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence, as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program."

Given the large number of asymptomatic cases of the disease, the infrared thermometers and health questionnaires frequently used to screen individuals are plainly inadequate. Existing SARS-CoV-2 detection technology is time consuming and complicated to use, expensive, not portable, and therefore ill-suited to use as point of care (POC) screening tools. Tests recently approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization face some of the same challenges. The goal of this project is to develop and test a novel breathalyzer for detecting aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 directly from exhaled breath in near real-time by marrying a proven, cutting-edge aerosol sampling technology with a novel and inexpensive virus detector. The innovation is directly detecting virus in the breath, while other breathalyzers depend on indirect detection (VOCs and AI algorithms) to infer the presence of the virus. In this Fast-track Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project, Aersol Devices Inc. (ADev) will modify its commercial bioaerosol collector, which is used to sample from the ambient environment, to enable it to collect viruses from breath samples into a concentrated liquid sample. The University of Minnesota (UMN) will modify its Magnetic Particle Spectrometer (MPS), a version of which has previously been used to detect Influenza A H1N1 virus, so that the liquid samples from the collector can be analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Specific aims include developing the hardware for transforming an ambient sampler into a breath sampler, designing a rapid means of decontaminating the collector between tests, integrating the collector and the detector into a robust package, functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, increasing the signal/noise ratio of the MPS electronics, reducing the assay time, improving the analytical sensitivity/specificity, measuring the clinical sensitivity/specificity and comparing to RT-qPCR in pre-clinical testing. The technology platform proposed is flexible and extensible and could be tailored to detect other pathogens (e.g., rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, other coronaviruses, etc.). This flexibility is valuable since (1) this will not be the last pandemic (new pathogens in the future), and (2) development could pivot to a different pathogen if a vaccine or other control measures bring the current COVID-19 pandemic under control before this SARS-CoV-2 breathalyzer is commercially available."

Our integrated approach first captures viral particles from patient samples to activate fluorescence reporters, followed by signal detection using a smartphone fluorimeter, along with blockchain-based data processing and tracing. We deployed designer DNA ""net"" nanostructures that match the spatial pattern of trimeric spike glycoprotein clusters on the viral outer surface for specific and rapid SARS-CoV-2 virion detection, a smartphone-based point-of-care device for portable signal reading, and blockchain encryption for privacy protection during result recording and track tracing.

When a person exhales into the COVID breathalyzer, droplets and other emitted particles are captured by a liquid impactor inside the collection unit. Subsequently, the captured particles are deposited onto a microfluidic chip that contains nanowell sensors (patent pending) capable of detecting the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The device will provide results within a time frame of 20 minutes using an impedance measurement approach. Importantly, we propose to develop a novel platform technology that could be easily adapted to future needs and challenges, not only as the virus causing COVID-19 evolves in future years, but also to provide multiplexing capabilities to detect multiple viruses in tandem. The target product profile (TPP) of our solution will stand out against the current and future standard of care in viral antigen screening tests as a new disposable breathalyzer that is not invasive compared to traditional sampling techniques, is easy to use with rapid point of care results, and has accurate reporting with high sensitivity and specificity."

Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment - to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of ""reopening"" are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis, we assert that a combination of novel assays, including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contain adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease, and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review. Incorporated into our timelines are appropriate regulatory milestones intended to conform with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) programs in effect for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics."

There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non-invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: - Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately &#36;9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately &#36;0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. - Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92&#37; sensitivity and 87&#37; specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1), and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models, will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. - Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 400 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. - Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan. A regulatory approval plan will be developed under the direction of Senior/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell &amp; Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to the FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate."

Some children and young adults who have had Covid-19 develop this rare disease about a month after they recover. It can be serious as it causes inflammation in various organs, including heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and intestines. MIS-C has symptoms similar to several diseases, including Covid-19 and Kawasaki disease, making diagnosis difficult. Currently, patients must undergo a battery of tests in order to diagnose MIS-C, including blood work, x-rays, and echocardiograms, which can take several days, delay treatment, and subject parents and children to the anxiety that is associated with an un-diagnosed, concerning illness. For the new diagnostic test, we are using an existing invention, a Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) chip. It's a small gold chip that can analyze up to 400 biomarkers at once, whereas common methods are only able to analyze one biomarker at a time. We hope to identify biomarkers that are only present, or are present in higher or lower numbers, when someone has MIS-C. The ability to include multiple biomarkers on one chip is very powerful as several biomarkers are likely involved with this disease. If we can identify these biomarkers, a doctor could place a drop of a patient's saliva or blood on the chip, and the chip will quickly tell if the patient has MIS-C or something else that looks like MIS-C. We are recruiting participants at four hospitals in the USA and Colombia, collecting their blood, saliva, and health information, and following them for up to four years. Scientists at five laboratories will study the blood and saliva to identify biomarkers, and also study the microbiome to better understand why some children develop MIS-C or become seriously ill, while others do not."

In 2020 alone, it costed a million lives. It continues to wreak economic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals who can then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment. Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries, including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timely processing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that can help identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge with symptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean; the heterogeneity of symptoms means that no single symptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that sudden partial or complete olfactory loss, even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough, is the single best predictor of COVID-19. In this proposal, we will develop and implement objective, self-administered smell tests for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as well as for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread. Several kinds of objective tests have been used in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test the ability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration an individual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach has technical and logistical advantages and disadvantages, and each captures different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. Regarding COVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure has the highest specificity or sensitivity. In Aim 1, we will use self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals to determine which olfactory measure is the best predictor of COVID-19. In Aim 2, we will use objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in University, municipal or other community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, our studies will provide a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at the individual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionally underserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.

Complementary to the temperature screening procedures currently in use, this tool is predicted to promote early identification of COVID onset leading to better prognoses and the early implementation of protocols to prevent community spread. Our specific plan is to use a hard-candy containing different combinations of tastants and flavors that are easy to distribute to a large population. During the development phase (Aim 1), this novel test will be compared with the NIH toolbox to assess the acceptability and efficacy of the two methods. We expect that the hard-candy assessment will be at least as efficacious in detecting chemosensory loss but more acceptable to subjects. Aim 2 will entail daily self-monitoring of chemosensory function in at-risk populations with data tracked through a secure online portal. The novelty of this confectionary-based test is that it provides standard stimuli that can yield objective measures of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of smell (aroma and flavor) and taste (sweet and sour). Moreover, both orthonasal and retronasal olfactory function will be independently assessed. The test can be self-administered and the familiar, pleasant nature of the stimuli should facilitate a high compliance rate, allowing for continuous monitoring over prolonged periods. Moreover, the test is rapid and inexpensive. Data will be incorporated into a predictive model for COVID-19 and assessed using AOC analyses of sensitivity and specificity. The [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) is a leading large public land grant University with a varied population of students, faculty, and support staff that includes all health care specialties.

With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. We seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models, and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers.

Because infected individuals may not have access to testing or may be asymptomatic, a proactive approach to detect the virus and to develop public health strategy to mitigate virus spread is needed. Recent studies have detected SAR-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage and demonstrated a positive correlation between the concentration of viral markers and reported cases1-5. The Coronavirus Sewershed Surveillance Project (CSSP) is a collaborative effort to monitor sewersheds for genetic indicators of COVID-19 in wastewater and to provide additional, population-level information about virus circulation that is not captured by clinical testing. Untreated wastewater (influent) samples are screened weekly from selected sewersheds and targeted micro-sewersheds for detection and &#8220;true&#8221; prevalence. Congregate facilities provide unique opportunities for study, because they are controlled populations where the precise number and timing of infections can be defined. Our team will utilize detailed monitoring of congregate facilities to define the precise per patient contribution and longevity of SARS-COV-2 RNA to wastewater by 1) increasing the number of tested facilities, 2) altering the frequency at which samples are collected, and 3) comparing collected sewershed data to clinical patient case data. Although SARS-COV-2 contribution/patient varies among communities, there have been clear outlier communities that produce little or no genetic material in the wastewater, despite the presence of known outbreaks. The reason for this lost signal is not known, so our team will define factors that contribute to SARS-COV-2 signal suppression in wastewater by 1) defining the physical nature of the genetic material in the sewershed to better understand the types of factors that could suppress signal, 2) expanding testing within sewersheds with suppressed signal and from additional facilities with similar population and industry demographics as those with suppressed signal to narrow the sources of signal suppression, 3) performing exhaustive chemical characterization to compare wastewater in suppressed locations and not suppressed locations, in order to identify candidate compounds that could be causing suppression, and 4) obtaining or generating candidate inhibitors and testing their ability to suppress signal from viral genetic material in a controlled experimental setting. Our team will further evaluate the utility of using wastewater RNA to determine what viral variants are circulating in a community. Towards this, we will 1) evaluate different methods, such as variant specific qPCR and targeted high throughput sequencing, for characterizing genetic material in wastewater, 2) develop methods for evaluating existing and emerging variants from wastewater, and 3) design platforms for communicating wastewater variant results to the public.

Frequent, low cost and highly scalable testing is the only way to gain visibility on the magnitude of the pandemic and ultimately control the spread of the disease. We propose the development of a unique system that can cheaply and readily detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples. The development of a system that uses saliva presents an opportunity to readily test patients using a sample that is easily collected and harbors high concentration of viral particles. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has predominantly affected individuals with pre-existing conditions such as clotting disorders, diabetes, hypertension or other chronic diseases. Patients with these pre-existing conditions, who are then infected, have exacerbated symptoms and complications that can lead to death. For example, many patients that have succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed blood clots that have impaired pulmonary or cardiac function and ultimately cardiac failure. A rapid diagnostic using easily collected samples (e.g. saliva) would allow for infections to be identified sooner, therapies to be administered quicker, treatment to be monitored, and ultimately leading to fewer individuals that succumb to the infection. We outline a novel DNA Star biosensing approach based on the fact that viruses, such as SARS- CoV-2, express unique spatial patterns of antigens on their surfaces, facilitating multivalent binding to host cells for infection. These configurations of epitopes drive the high sensitivity and specificity of our assay. Based on this naturally occurring binding mechanism, we developed a rational design approach producing pattern matching designer DNA architecture for viral sensing. A proof-of-concept Dengue virus (DENV) rapid diagnostics was developed to demonstrate its power; DENV surface antigens present the most complex geometric pattern among all known pathogens, a DNA star linked 10-aptamers nanostructure that offers polyvalent, spatial DENV- epitope pattern matching interactions has provided high DENV-binding avidity and specificity, increasing affinity by ~1,000&#215; compared to the conventional aptamer approach which relies on monovalent aptamer-epitope interactions. Our POCT diagnostics detected intact DENV virions in patient samples with PCR equivalent sensitivity in &lt;2 mins at a cost &lt;$0.15. Current RT-PCR molecular test is suited to large, centralized laboratories, and difficult to scale for rapid testing of samples and delivery of results to clinicians and patients. Immunoassay tests have lower sensitivity, and patients need to develop a response to the virus in order to detect the antibody response. Our ""DNA star"" biosensor-based rapid diagnostics will provide the infrastructure for real time SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that is easy to use (instrument-free), faster (sample to results in minutes) and cost effective (~$3 per test)."

With this pandemic came massive shut downs of both private and public businesses including schools, retail stores, and restaurants. In order to be able to safely open these places of business and have millions of workers return to work and children return to school safely, there is a dire need for a rapid, simple, and inexpensive test which can be administered in non-clinical settings including businesses, schools, and even at home. There are over 600 tests currently being developed, including potentially promising tests using saliva samples and nasopharyngeal swabs. However, these tests have several disadvantages including requirement of instruments, discomfort with nasopharyngeal swabs, and/or long processing time.In this proposal, we aim to develop a simple, low-cost, rapid saliva-based test using test strips that incorporate novel high affinity SARS-CoV-2 binder nanodiscs. Our aims are focused on producing and optimizing the test strip components and performing a feasibility study on archived patient samples. By completing these goals, we hope to produce test strips that have the capability of use in office settings, schools, sports events, and potentially at home.

However, given the natural lack of awareness of chemosensory changes, self-reports underestimate the true prevalence of smell loss in patients with COVID-19 by 20% compared to an objective test. Therefore, we propose testing and deploying a rapid and objective measure of smell ability, the SCENTinel test, inspired by the NIH Toolbox&#174; Odor Identification Test that our team developed. SCENTinel is an inexpensive, convenient, and robust smell test for COVID-19 surveillance of the population that quickly and easily assesses three smell loss factors: odor detection, odor intensity, and odor identification. It is designed for practical use in several contexts, including high-density areas, such as community medical sites, universities, subacute care facilities, and both industrial and nonindustrial workplaces. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in understanding taste and smell, developing and validating chemosensory tests, and studying the broad symptomatology of COVID-19. This project aims to a) fine-tune SCENTinel's ability to predict a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test; b) examine marginal smell loss as a sign of the earliest phases of COVID-19, before a positive diagnostic test; and c) assess the test's psychometric validity with test-retest reliability measures and validation against the NIH Toolbox&#174; Odor Identification Test. Together, these aims will establish a standardized protocol for use of SCENTinel as a rapid and objective smell test that can easily be incorporated into onsite COVID-19 testing centers, schools, and workplaces nationwide. Furthermore, it will provide key insights into early-onset chemosensory symptoms in relation to a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, providing a crucially needed means to contain the spread of COVID-19. "

Between a shortage in testing and unidentified asymptomatic individuals, the actual number of those infected could be 6 to 24-fold higher than that reported. SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the virus underlying the disease, results in a range of symptoms; in select cases a severe respiratory illness that impedes breathing that could lead to hospitalization and death. CoV-2 is transmitted person-to-person via inhalation of the virus through mucosal membranes of the nose and throat from transfer after touching a contaminated surface or by inhaling aerosolized virus. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is likely to be prevalent well into 2021 and beyond. We must increase our ability to test for CoV-2. First, testing is needed to diagnose individuals that are symptomatic or asymptomatic to reduce community spread. And second, monitoring gathering areas for airborne virus that could inform the decision to shutdown a space or implement disinfection and mitigation of an area. We propose to use an electrochemical biosensor in two detection devices, 1) a diagnostic breathalyzer for instant detection of CoV-2 and 2) an airborne detector for real-time, continuous surveillance of a large space. We have developed a novel ultra-sensitive, antibody-based electrochemical biosensor to detect CoV-2 repeat binding domain (RBD) spike protein. The technology is based on a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE) biosensor pioneered by the Cirrito laboratory to study protein dynamics in the setting of neurodegeneration (2,3). The biosensor uses voltammetry to measure the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids; oxidation is the release of electrons that the biosensor measures as a change in current. Antibodies are covalently attached to the electrode surface to provide selectivity. Our prototype CoV-2 biosensor is sensitive to 2 femtogram/ml, compared to several current CoV-2 antigen tests that are sensitive to the low picogram/ml range. The proposal will first (Aim 1) optimize our CoV-2 biosensor to detect CoV-2 viral particles, as well as test several parameters to increase sensitivity and longevity. Aim 2 will build a test breathalyzer that will utilize a nebulizer to generate virus laden air containing aerosol droplets similar to a breath that contain defined concentrations of CoV-2 viral particles. Aim 3 will test the airborne biosensor in a realistic environment. Co-I Chakrabarty's laboratory has unique capabilities of mimicking real-world environmental conditions, especially in the context of atmospheric aerosols, necessary for testing and optimizing the biosensor&#39;s performance for field deployment. Atmospheric conditions include relative humidity (RH) and temperature, as well as common airborne pollutants found indoors. Finding novel means to detect the CoV-2, as well as create a platform to detect other and future pathogens, would enable us to limit the viral spread throughout the community in the current and future pandemics.

As this study is a technology development, the data generated do not involve anything related to human samples or human subjects.

There are different assays for COVID-19, including nucleic acid, serological, antigen, and ancillary tests used in hospitals. In this study we will develop a biochip assay that can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 protein and RNA from biofluids by using surface markers, while simultaneously detecting/quantifying target proteins and RNA at single virus resolution. Amplification of the signals will be achieved by targeting different regions of the viral RNA (e.g., viral nucleocapsid N1, N2), and a tyramide signal amplification (TSA) assay for viral surface proteins. To demonstrate the clinical utility of the technology, it will be tested with different biofluids, including nasopharyngeal secretions and saliva from COVID-19 patients. "

While progress has been made in the development of methods and in the interpretation of data, much remains to be improved for the technology to be used as a public health management tool. A major drawback in the current approaches are: 1) the lack of streamlined and consistent pre-analytical processing steps, 2) coverage across the relevant targets requires a high number of reactions (&gt;20) from any singe sample to provide quantitative information, and 3) a lack of vision of the development of a pathogen/marker panel, much like those used in clinical arenas, for the interpretation of data across different states, regions, and nations. The goal of this project will be to successfully navigate these three limitations toward development of an advanced digital array PCR system as part of the development of a public health warning system that is not dependent on clinical testing and has the ability to rapidly address novel pathogen threats in the future.

The centerpiece of this proposal is the ""Rolosense"" technology, which leverages a DNA micromotor as the virus sensing and transduction material (VSTM) that can be detected by a conventional smart phone camera. This provides both geographical tracing and surveillance. Rolosense motors are comprised by a DNA-coated spherical particle (5 micrometers diameter) that hybridizes to a surface bound with complementary RNA. The particle moves at speeds of over 1 micron/minute upon the addition of RNase H, which selectively hydrolyses hybridized RNA but not single-stranded RNA. DNA motors coated with virus binding ligand (VBL) stall in presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. Because motors move autonomously for distances up to millimeters without intervention, the assay is fully automated, and conventional steps such as viral inactivation, RNA isolation, and amplification are not required. The readout is performed using an automated smart phone app for particle tracking without the need for a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. Preliminary data shows real time SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle sensing. Milestones include the screening and identification of high affinity and high specificity VBLs. Both aptamers and antibody VBLs will be screening and validated. Simulations and experiments will be used to understand the role of temperature and environmental conditions in modulating Rolosense performance. Multivalent display of VBLs with DNA origami will enhance avidity. Finally, microfluidic chips with airborne droplet capture will be implemented and tested. The work will be performed by a highly interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise and a track-record of co-publications. Principal Investigator Salaita invented the Rolosense technology and has past experience in developing cell phone diagnostics and synthetic motors. Co-Investigator Melikian is an expert virologist, Co-Investigator Heemstra is an expert at developing aptamers for novel targets, Co-Investigator Ke has extensive experience in DNA origami structures for avid target binding and has co-authored work on Rolosense, and Co-Investigators Rajaraman and Primordia are experts at microfluidic device development and commercialization. Our solution offers the potential to provide an immediate solution to today&#39;s urgent virus sensing and tracing needs."

In contrast to immunological and genetic based methods that use sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how the human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine an automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analyses on up to 760 patients, and to identify and validate COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from the current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) from negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine - Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital -Detroit). We will conduct breath analyses using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2. We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings."

Standard PCR based assays still result in very high false negative rates in the earliest days of infection. Microfluidic processing of clinical samples is low cost and shows great promise for translating most liquid biopsy assays to the clinic. Our laboratory was one of the first to apply microfluidic technologies for the isolation of both circulating tumor cells and exosomes in the blood of patients with cancer. For SARS-CoV-2 patients, saliva, stool, and plasma are all thought to be potential resources for both virus detection, as well as other clinical biomarkers that might inform us of infection. Thus, we seek to optimize our exosome capture technology, the EVHB-Chip, for the isolation of intact SARS-CoV-2 virus, testing its utility for each of these biofluids. To complete this work, we will complete a full clinical validation and benchmarking of the assay. Once fully optimized, our detection assay will be compared against existing emergency use authorization (EUA) SARS-CoV-2 detection assays to determine detection sensitivity and specificity. Further, we plan to demonstrate that the increased sensitivity and specificity enabled by our microfluidic device will result in earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2, reducing false negatives in this testing window. At the completion of this work, we will have collected the data training sets and submitted a full EUA plan that would enable the FDA's authorization of our test to be used in the clinic. "

It is now known that severe infection can occur in both young children and young adults (&lt; 21) and that nearly 40% of those who are admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, including mechanical ventilation. One of the most severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a serious condition associated with severe inflammation with multi-organ involvement that can result in a variety of clinical presentations including pneumonia, sepsis, coagulation abnormalities, and renal failure. Thus, novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA-omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swabs and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)."

In the face of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and with single-plex qPCR fluorometry inadequate for high throughput clinical diagnostics, the demand for testing exceeds the capacity, leading to limited availability, long queue times, backlogs in COVID-19 diagnoses, and delayed access to specialized treatment for COVID-19 patients. The goal of this RADx funded project is to develop an easily scalable and massively paralleled multiplexed screening method by next generation sequencing (NGS) with sample-specific barcoded indexes to allow pooling of up to 9200 samples. The approach enables detection of SARS-COV-2 viral gRNA content (load) and expression profiles along with the simultaneous detection of the host&#39;s transcriptional response to infection (expression profile). Transcriptional profiles are analyzed in the context of clinical data (electronic medical records of symptoms, treatments, and outcomes) in order to identify and select features (biomarkers) that are predictive of clinical outcomes using machine learning methods. These selected biomarkers are then validated in independent clinical samples. Comparative testing of alternative samples (nasopharyngeal swab (NP), saliva, oral swab) and handling protocols is ongoing with the goal of matching new protocols with existing SOPs for PCR-based testing in CLIA-certified facilities. In addition to increasing testing throughput, this precision medicine approach may provide a very early look at who may be asymptomatic but infectious, or who is about to get very sick. Methods developed during this project may be adaptable to viruses or other pathogens in future pandemics. The initial aim of this project is to demonstrate proof of principle that the methodology can capture both virus and host RNA sequences using commercially available anonymous NP, oropharyngeal, and saliva samples."

We employ a computational design to deduce sets of odorant binding peptide (OBP) sequences that will selectively bind to exhaled VOCs associated with SARS-CoV-2 from libraries of olfactory proteins. Chimeric peptides including these OBP sequences and a aromatic carbon-binding group are then synthesized, validated for vapor phase VOC binding, and then bound to separate low-cost graphene and carbon nanotube sensor field effect transistors in multiplexed arrays developed in this project. The exhalant or simulated exhalant response data from these multiplexed OBP-functionalized sensor arrays will be used to train an AI-driven diagnosis system to create a rapid, easily scalable test for SARS-CoV-2 based on direct exhaled breath."

However, self-report of smell function is an unreliable predictor of smell loss. We created a self-administered easy to use ""at home"" 5-minute objective smell test to uncover alterations in smell function unbeknownst to many individuals. Our new smell test consists of a physical smell card containing peel and sniff odor labels and a web-based application. Each participant accesses the web-based app on their own smartphone, tablet, or computer. We developed a native app to: (Aim 1) conduct a longitudinal COVID smell test, (Aim 2) collect data on asymptomatic health care workers, symptomatic patients, and undergraduates, and (Aim 3) develop algorithms for the longitudinal smell test for personalized thresholds and differentiate smell loss from COVID relative to influenza. The longitudinal COVID smell test is accessible, affordable, and readily scalable. Effective screening with the COVID smell test will better inform students and employees if they should not report to school or work, and instead seek an evaluation by a healthcare professional."

Current qPCR tests are specific and sensitive, but lengthy turnaround times limit interventions against disease spread. Antibody testing is faster, but false-positive/negative rates are high. Here, we propose to repurpose extracellular vesicle (EV) separation and characterization technologies into a fully automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that is low-cost, accurate, sensitive, rapid (within 3 h), and practical. The device will be optimized to analyze blood, saliva, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected at home, without risking transmission to healthcare workers. The sample is processed with an automated device developed with Sognef, and data are transferred to the Sognef servers for analysis through an app that can be downloaded to any smart device. This technology is similar to Abbott's recently launched BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, but has the advantage of multiparametric detection of viral RNA (vRNA), including Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein-coding regions, plus a panel of host EV microRNAs (exomiRs) that reveals infection even when viral loads are below detectable limits. This approach will decrease false-positives/negatives, the major limitation of antigen/antibody tests. Examine relationships of miRNA panels with characteristics such as: symptomatic vs asymptomatic, qPCR-determined viral load, biological sex, age (including pediatric populations), and comorbidities. We will optimize a COVID-19 device that uses simple bind-elute microfluidics for sample separation followed by electrical, probe-based detection of i) all validated exomiRs from Aim 1 and ii) our three conserved vRNAs. We envision that the device will be used first for either finger-pricked blood or saliva, followed, if positive, by an optional confirmatory second test of NP swab viral transport medium (VTM) that could be done with the same device. We will then test the device in multiple centers worldwide in two phases: Phase 1 - every center will perform a double-blinded validation using their biorepository specimen, and Phase 2 - in a &#946;-testing phase, we will provide a large number of devices to healthcare providers for regular testing of workers."
