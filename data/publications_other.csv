,,doi:10.1109/ICHI54592.2022.00070,IMI-CDE: an interactive interface for collaborative mapping of study variables to common data elements,"The National Institute of Health (NIH) launches the RADx Radical research collaboratives (RADx-rad) to advance new, non-traditional approaches for COVID-19 testing. RADx-rad projects are required to adopt common data elements (CDEs) to collect data to increase data interoperability. To overcome the challenges in finding appropriate CDEs for a wide range of study variables, we create a web application - IMI-CDE to ease the burden of mapping study variables to CDEs from researchers. IMI-CDE can automatically recommend CDE candidates for a study variable based on its name and description. Together with interactive mapping interfaces, IMI-CDE allows researchers to perform variable-CDE mapping with one mouse click. In addition, the IMI-CDE application supports users with multiple roles to work collaboratively on the mapping tasks. We have piloted the IMI-CDE with RADx-rad projects. 22 researchers from 8 different projects have started to use the IMI-CDE system for variable-CDE mappings. The beta-testing evaluators reported the system is intuitive, effective, and easy to use.","[COVID-19,Common Data Element,CDE Mapping,Data Dictionary,Study Variable,CDE Recommendation]",[],[],"[Tao S,Chou WC,Li J,Du J,Ram PM,Abeysinghe R,Xu H,Jiang J,Rose PW,Ohno-Machado L,Zhang G]",2022 IEEE 10th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),[Proceedings],2022,LM013755,,,,,
,,doi:10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06434,Understanding Oligonucleotide Hybridization and the Role of Anchoring on the Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Corona Phase for Viral Sensing Applications,"Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored corona phases (CPs), or surface-adsorbed molecules, have emerged as a promising interface for sensing applications. The adsorption of an analyte can be specifically transduced as a modulation of their band-gap near-infrared (nIR) photoluminescence (PL). One such CP ideal for this purpose is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where subsequent sequence-dependent hybridization can result in PL emission wavelength shifts. Due to ssDNA adsorption to the SWCNT surface, the resultant noncanonical hybridization and its effect on SWCNT photophysical properties are not well understood. In this work, we study 20- and 21-mer DNA and RNA hybridization on the complementary ssDNA-SWCNT CP in the context of nucleic acid sensing for SARS-CoV-2 sequences as model analytes. We found that the van’t Hoff transition enthalpy of hybridization on SWCNT CP was −11.9 kJ mol–1, much lower than that of hybridization in solution (−707 kJ mol–1). We used SWCNT solvatochromism to calculate the solvent-exposed surface area to indicate successful hybridization. We found that having a 30-mer anchor region in addition to the complementary region significantly improved PL response sensitivity and selectivity, with a (GT)15 anchor preferred for RNA targets. Coincubation of ssDNA-SWCNTs with an analyte at 37 °C resulted in faster hybridization kinetics without sacrificing specificity. Other methods aimed to improve CP rearrangement kinetics such as bath sonication and surfactant additions were ineffective. We also determined that the target sequence choice is important as secondary structure formation in the target is negatively correlated with hybridization. Best-performing CPs showed detection limits of 11 and 13 nM for DNA and RNA targets, respectively. Finally, we simulated sensing conditions using the saliva environment, showing sensor compatibility in biofluids. In total, this work elucidates key design features and processing to enable sequence-specific hybridization on ssDNA-SWCNT CPs.","[Carbon nanotubes,Genetics,Hybridization,Quantum mechanics,Sensors]",[],[],"[Cui J,Gong X,Cho S-Y,Jin X,Yang S,Khosravi-Far R,Strano MS]",J Phys Chem C,[Journal Article],2023,DE030829,,,,,

Materials and methods: We recruited cohorts from three sites: Federal Way, WA; Springdale, AR; and remotely. Participants received a survey that included demographic characteristics and questions regarding COVID-19. Participants completed symptom checks via text message every month and recorded their temperature daily using a Kinsa smart thermometer. Results: Recruitment and data collection is ongoing. Presently, 441 adults have consented to participate. One-third of participants were classified as essential workers during the pandemic. Discussion: Over the past 18 months, we have improved our strategies to elicit better data from participants and have learned from some of the weaknesses in our initial deployment of this type of surveillance system. Other limitations stem from historic inequities and barriers which limited Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island representation in academic and clinical environments. One manifestation of this was the limited ability to provide study materials and support in multiple languages. We hope that continued partnership with the community will allow further opportunities to help restore trust in academic and medical institutions, thus generating knowledge to advance health equity. Conclusion: This participatory disease surveillance mechanism complements traditional surveillance systems by engaging underserved communities. We may also gain insights generalizable to other pathogens of concern.",[],[],[],"[Morgan ER,Dillard D,Lofgren E,Maddison BK,Riklon S,McElfish P,Sinclair KI]",Contemp Clin Trials Commun.,[Journal Article],2023,MD016526
